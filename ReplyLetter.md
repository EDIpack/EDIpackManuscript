Dear Editors,

We would like to thank you for considering our manuscript
“A flexible and interoperable high-performance Lanczos-based solver for generic quantum impurity problems: upgrading EDIpack” (SciPost submission ID: scipost_202506_00023v1), which we hereby resubmit for publication.

We are grateful to both referees for their insightful and constructive reviews, as well as for recognizing the value of our work. Both referees considered the manuscript worthy of publication and recommended it accordingly. In particular, Referee A described the paper as “*well written and highly detailed*”, highlighting that it “*makes a valuable contribution to the community*”. Likewise, Referee B emphasized that “*providing robust and well-tested computer codes, as well as high quality documentation, are a big service to the community*” and “*wholeheartedly recommend*[ed] *this work for publication*”. We deeply appreciate these encouraging evaluations and believe the feedback we received has helped us significantly improve the manuscript.

In our responses, enclosed with this resubmission, we have carefully addressed all comments and suggestions raised by the referees and the anonymous commenter.
