\section{Introduction and Motivation}\label{SecIntro}

A few words about the motivations who led us to develop this
software, possible applications and advantages:


* flexibility: can address generic cases including multi-orbital,
superconducting or spin-non-conserving regimes

* zero and low finite temperatures

* direct access to (well approximated) analytic dynamical functions

* direct access to impurity Fock space quantities
