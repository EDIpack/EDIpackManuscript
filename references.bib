@article{Amaricci2017EL,
	abstract = {We investigate the metal-insulator Mott transition in a generalized version of the periodic Anderson model, in which a band of itinerant non-interacting electrons is hybridrized with a narrow and strongly correlated band. Using the dynamical mean-field theory, we show that the precondition for the Mott transition is that the total filling of the two bands takes an odd integer value. Unlike the conventional portrait of the Mott transition, this condition corresponds to a non-integer filling of the correlated band. For an integer constant occupation of the correlated orbitals the system remains a correlated metal at arbitrary large interaction strength. We picture the transition at a non-integer filling of the correlated orbital as the Mott localization of the singlet states between itinerant and strongly interacting electrons, having occupation of one per lattice site. We show that the Mott transition is of the first order and we characterize the nature of the resulting insulating state with respect to relevant physical parameters, such as the charge-transfer energy.},

	abstract = {We present EDIpack, an exact diagonalization package to solve generic quantum impurity problems. The algorithm includes a generalization of the look-up method introduced in Ref. [1] and enables a massively parallel execution of the matrix-vector linear operations required by Lanczos and Arnoldi algorithms. We show that a suitable Fock basis organization is crucial to optimize the inter-processors communication in a distributed memory setup and to reach sub-linear scaling in sufficiently large systems. We discuss the algorithm in details indicating how to deal with multiple orbitals and electron-phonon coupling. Finally, we outline the download, installation and functioning of the package.

	abstract = {Dirac fermions play a central role in the study of topological phases, for they can generate a variety of exotic states, such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators. The control and manipulation of Dirac fermions constitute a fundamental step toward the realization of novel concepts of electronic devices and quantum computation. By means of Angle-Resolved Photo-Emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and ab initio simulations, here, we show that Dirac states can be effectively tuned by doping a transition metal sulfide, BaNiS2, through Co/Ni substitution. The symmetry and chemical characteristics of this material, combined with the modification of the charge-transfer gap of BaCo1−xNixS2 across its phase diagram, lead to the formation of Dirac lines, whose position in k-space can be displaced along the Γ−M symmetry direction and their form reshaped. Not only does the doping x tailor the location and shape of the Dirac bands, but it also controls the metal-insulator transition in the same compound, making BaCo1−xNixS2 a model system to functionalize Dirac materials by varying the strength of electron correlations.},

	abstract = {The topological classification of electronic band structures is based on symmetry properties of Bloch eigenstates of single-particle Hamiltonians. In parallel, topological field theory has opened the doors to the formulation and characterization of non-trivial phases of matter driven by strong electron-electron interaction. Even though important examples of topological Mott insulators have been constructed, the relevance of the underlying non-interacting band topology to the physics of the Mott phase has remained unexplored. Here, we show that the momentum structure of the Green's function zeros defining the ``Luttinger surface" provides a topological characterization of the Mott phase related, in the simplest description, to the one of the single-particle electronic dispersion. Considerations on the zeros lead to the prediction of new phenomena: a topological Mott insulator with an inverted gap for the bulk zeros must possess gapless zeros at the boundary, which behave as a form of ``topological antimatter''annihilating conventional edge states. Placing band and Mott topological insulators in contact produces distinctive observable signatures at the interface, revealing the otherwise spectroscopically elusive Green's function zeros.},

	the hugely popular Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing.
	The product of a unique collaboration among four leading scientists
	in academic research and industry Numerical Recipes is a complete
	text and reference book on scientific computing. In a self-contained
	manner it proceeds from mathematical and theoretical considerations
	to actual practical computer routines. With over 100 new routines
	bringing the total to well over 300, plus upgraded versions of the
	original routines, this new edition remains the most practical,comprehensive
	handbook of scientific computing available today. Highlights of the
	new material include: - A new chapter on integral equations and inverse
	methods - Multigrid and other methods for solving partial differential
	equations - Improved random number routines - Wavelet transforms
	- The statistical bootstrap method - A new chapter on 'less-numerical'
	algorithms including compression coding and arbitrary precision arithmetic.
	The book retains the informal easy-to-read style that made the first
	edition so popular, while introducing some more advanced topics.
	It is an ideal text book for scientists and engineers and an indispensable
	reference for anyone who works in scientific computing. The Second
	Edition is available in FORTRAN, the traditional language for numerical
	calculations, and in the increasingly popular C language.},

We compute and store only I↑ or I↓ at a time to generate the full Hamiltonian matrix. The non-diagonal part of the Hamiltonian matrix given as I↓⊗H↑⊕H↓⊗I↑ is generated using a bottom-up approach by computing the small matrices H↑ (spin up hopping Hamiltonian) and H↓ (spin down hopping Hamiltonian) and then forming the tensor product with respective identity matrices I↓ and I↑, thereby saving significant computation time and memory. We find that the total CPU time to generate the non-diagonal part of the Hamiltonian matrix using the new one spin configuration basis scheme is reduced by about an order of magnitude as compared to the two spin configuration basis scheme. The present scheme is shown to be inherently parallelizable. Its application to translationally invariant systems, computation of Green's functions and in impurity solver part of DMFT procedure is discussed and its extension to other models is also pointed out.},

We study two quantum lattice models with different particle numbers, and conclude that for small systems, the multi-core CPU is the fastest platform, while for large systems, the graphics processor is the clear winner, reaching speedups of up to 7.6 compared to the CPU.

	abstract = {Efficient parallel multiplication of sparse matrices is key to enabling many large-scale calculations. This article presents the DBCSR (Distributed Block Compressed Sparse Row) library for scalable sparse matrix--matrix multiplication and its use in the CP2K program for linear-scaling quantum-chemical calculations. The library combines several approaches to implement sparse matrix multiplication in a way that performs well and is demonstrably scalable. Parallel communication has well-defined limits. Data volume decreases with O(1/P) with increasing process counts P and every process communicates with at most O(P) others. Local sparse matrix multiplication is handled efficiently using a combination of techniques: blocking elements together in an application-relevant way, an autotuning library for small matrix multiplications, cache-oblivious recursive multiplication, and multithreading. Additionally, on-the-fly filtering not only increases sparsity but also avoids performing calculations that fall below the filtering threshold. We demonstrate and analyze the performance of the DBCSR library and its various scaling behaviors.},

@article{Boer1937POTPS,
	abstract = {Attention is drawn to a class of semi-conductors or insulators with incompletely filled 3d bands. Their lack of conductivity, if the number of electrons per atom is an integer, is explained by the circumstance that a moving electron will have a large probability of being withdrawn to the initial atom, if only the potential barriers to be penetrated are sufficiently high to reduce the frequency of transition below a certain limit. This inhibiting factor disappears, if for ions of equal electronic levels the number of electrons per atom differs from an integer. In the case of NiO this condition is fulfilled if an electron is brought by thermal excitation from the lattice 3d band into the somewhat raised and less occupied levels a, a' (figure 1); these levels belong to Ni ions adjacent to a vacant Ni lattice point introduced by the deviations from stoichiometry, and two of these Ni ions are at the absolute zero Ni3+ ions. An analogous conduction mechanism holds for non-stoichiometric Cu2O, with a completely filled 3d band (figure 2).
Photoconductivity is generally observed with substances with completely filled zones and never with substances of the NiO type. A tentative explanation is given for this fact on the basis of the model of figure 1 and figure 2.
In non-stoechiometric ZnO vacant oxygen lattice points are assumed (figure 3); in that case the calculation of the lattice levels shows that at the lattice holes one Zn2+ is converted into Zn, whereas in the lattice the additional electrons form Zn+ ions, as will be the case after thermal transitions of the electrons belonging to these Zn atoms into the lattice 4s band.},

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

The discussion is an adaptation of Brueckner's theory of nuclear matter. It is assumed that electrons interact with each other only when they are at the same atom. The effect of the electron correlation depends in an intricate way on the energy spectrum of a given band. An approximate expression of the effective magnitude of the interaction is derived. The condition for the occurrence of ferromagnetism is investigated for various types of bands. The ferromagnetism of Ni and the paramagnetism of Pd can be understood reasonably through the present approach.

	abstractnote = {A generalization of the theory of correlation effects in narrow s-bands, applicable to narrow degenerate electron bands, is developed. The theory is based on the notion that in the case of narrow bands the most important correlations are those between electrons on the same atom. The solution obtained has the important property of going over into the ordinary band theory solution in the appropriate limit (no interaction) and the exact atomic (HeitierLondon) solution in the opposite limit (zero band-width). In order to elucidate the general properties of the solution some simplified models are discussed, and the more elementary implications of the theory when applied to the d-bands of transition metals are indicated. A physical interpretation of the results of the theory is given; the physical picture which emerges is found to be closely related to a theory discussed earlier by Van Vleck. (auth)},

	abstract = {{Based on the s-d interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.}},

The new formulation has the advantage of being conceptually simpler than the earlier theory; it can, in fact, be developed in close analogy with the usual theory of spin waves. It is shown that the simplest approximations in the new formulation lead to theories of the crystal field, the Weiss molecular field, spin waves, polarization waves and the quasi-electron theory of the earlier papers of this series. The new formulation permits one to take into account the interactions of electrons on different atoms and to consider solutions of the anti-ferromagnetic and more complicated kinds. The theory is developed by the `equation of motion' method. },

	abstract = {An intuitive topological proof is given of the no-go theorem for putting Weyl fermions in weak interaction on a lattice, or for constructing chiral invariant lattice QCD, which was proved by a homotopy theory argument in our preceding paper (Absence I). This theorem hangs on the existence of the charge (e.g. fermion number), and thus on the complex-field formulation and on locality. If we relax the assumptions for the no-go theorem, for instance the existence of the charge, and thus use the real-field formulation, we can construct a model that has only one two-component field. We can assign this model an only approximately conserved charge.},

	abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

In the present paper the same limit is applied to a family of lattice fermion models with generalized kinetic and potential energies. A simple method is introduced for investigating the important issue of handling momentum conservation at the interaction vertices. It is shown that the irrelevance of momentum conservation found by Metzner and Vollhardt applies more generally than their Gaussian density of states. Interactions between particles on different sites are shown to simplify to their Hartree substitute. This leaves on-site interactions as the only dynamical interactions in the limit of infinite dimension.},

We first illustrate some simple physical ideas to motivate such an approach and then present a systematic derivation of the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg (CSLG) action for the FQHE, starting from the microscopic Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that all the phenomenological aspects of the FQHE can be derived from the mean field solution and the small fluctuations of the CSLG action. Although this formalism is logically independent of Laughlin's wave function approach, their physical consequences are equivalent. The CSLG theory demonstrates a deep connection between the phenomena of superfluidity and the FQHE, and can provide a simple and direct formalism to address many new macroscopic phenomena of the FQHE. },

@article{Hulsenbeck1994ZFPBCM,
	abstract = {The present paper studies the properties of Hubbard-like models in high spatial dimensionsD. In a first par the limit of infinite dimension and its main features-i.e.i) the mapping onto a generalized atomic model with an additional auxiliary field andii) the validity of the local approximation for the self-energy-are worked out in a systematic (1/D)-expansion. Since the hopping matrix elements have to be properly scaled with the dimensionD, the (1/D)-expansion is also an expansion in the hopping amplitude. Thus for small hopping theD{\textrightarrow}∞-limit may serve as a proper approximation for finite-dimensional systems. The second part of the paper adopts the hybridisation-perturbation theory of the single impurity Anderson model in order to construct a perturbation theory for the auxiliary field of the generalized atom which can also be interpreted as an expansion in the hopping amplitude. The non-crossing approximation (NCA) is used to study the antiferromagnetic phase transtion of theD{\textrightarrow}∞-Hubbard model in the case of half filling: the critical temperature, the antiferromagnetic order parameter and the free energy of the lattice system are calculated. The NCA-results are in quite good agreement with recent results from the imaginary-time discretisation method.},

@article{Kato2004S,
	abstract = {Electrically induced electron-spin polarization near the edges of a semiconductor channel was detected and imaged with the use of Kerr rotation microscopy. The polarization is out-of-plane and has opposite sign for the two edges, consistent with the predictions of the spin Hall effect. Measurements of unstrained gallium arsenide and strained indium gallium arsenide samples reveal that strain modifies spin accumulation at zero magnetic field. A weak dependence on crystal orientation for the strained samples suggests that the mechanism is the extrinsic spin Hall effect.},

We explainhow the polarization is closely related to a Berry phase of the Bloch wavefunctions asthe wavevector is carried across the Brillouin zone, or equivalently, to the centers ofcharge of Wannier functions constructed from the Bloch wavefunctions. A resultingfeature of this formulation is that the polarization is formally defined only modulo a``quantum of polarization'' -- in other words, that the polarization may be regardedas a multi-valued quantity. We discuss the consequences of this theory for thephysical understanding of ferroelectric materials, including polarization reversal,piezoelectric effects, and the appearance of polarization charges at surfacesand interfaces. In so doing, we give a few examples of realistic calculationsof polarization-related quantities in perovskite ferroelectrics, illustratinghow the present approach provides a robust and powerful foundation formodern computational studies of dielectric and ferroelectric materials. },

	abstract = {Phase transitions between the quantum spin Hall (QSH) and the insulator phases in three dimensions (3D) are studied. We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems there appears a gapless phase between the QSH and insulator phases in 3D which is in contrast with the 2D case. Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless points (diabolical points) in 3D, but not in 2D.},

	abstract = {The nature of the metal-insulator Mott transition at zero temperature has been discussed for a number of years. Whether it occurs through a quantum critical point or through a first-order transition is expected to profoundly influence the nature of the finite-temperature phase diagram. In this paper, we study the zero temperature Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice with the variational cluster approximation. This takes into account the influence of antiferromagnetic short-range correlations. By contrast to single-site dynamical mean-field theory, the transition turns out to be first order even at zero temperature.},

	abstract = {A time-reversal (TR) invariant topological insulator can be generally defined by the effective topological field theory with a quantized θ coefficient, which can only take values of 0 or π. This theory is generally valid for an arbitrarily interacting system and the quantization of the θ invariant can be directly measured experimentally. Reduced to the case of a non-interacting system, the θ invariant can be expressed as an integral over the entire three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Alternatively, non-interacting insulators can be classified by topological invariants defined over discrete TR invariant momenta. In this paper, we show the complete equivalence between the integral and the discrete invariants of the topological insulator.},

	abstract = {Using k·p theory, we derive an effective four-band model describing the physics of the typical two-dimensional topological insulator (HgTe/CdTe quantum well (QW)) in the presence of an out-of-plane (in the z-direction) inversion breaking potential and an in-plane potential. We find that up to third order in perturbation theory, only the inversion breaking potential generates new elements to the four-band Hamiltonian that are off-diagonal in spin space. When this new effective Hamiltonian is folded into an effective two-band model for the conduction (electron) or valence (heavy hole) bands, two competing terms appear: (i) a Rashba spin--orbit interaction originating from inversion breaking potential in the z-direction and (ii) an in-plane Pauli term as a consequence of the in-plane potential. Spin transport in the conduction band is further analysed within the Landauer--B{\"u}ttiker formalism. We find that for asymmetrically doped HgTe QWs, the behaviour of the spin-Hall conductance is dominated by the Rashba term.},

@article{Bauer2011JOSMTAE,
	abstract = {We present release 2.0 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion systems. The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats, libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful framework for programmers to develop their own applications, which, for instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel, distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of HDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow provenance tool. The software is available from our web server at http://alps.comp-phys.org/.},

@article{Chang2013S,
	abstract = {The Hall effect, an electromagnetic phenomenon with a straightforward explanation, has many exotic counterparts, including a quantized version occurring independently of the presence of external magnetic fields. Inspired by a theoretical prediction of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetically doped topological insulator thin films, Chang et al. (p. 167, published online 14 March; see the Perspective by Oh) prepared thin films of the compound Cr0.15(Bi0.1Sb0.9)1.85Te3, with Cr as the magnetic dopant. They observed a plateau in the Hall resistance as a function of the gating voltage without any applied magnetic fields, signifying the achievement of the QAH state.The quantized version of the anomalous Hall effect has been predicted to occur in magnetic topological insulators, but the experimental realization has been challenging. Here, we report the observation of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, a magnetic topological insulator. At zero magnetic field, the gate-tuned anomalous Hall resistance reaches the predicted quantized value of h/e2, accompanied by a considerable drop in the longitudinal resistance. Under a strong magnetic field, the longitudinal resistance vanishes, whereas the Hall resistance remains at the quantized value. The realization of the QAH effect may lead to the development of low-power-consumption electronics.},

@article{Georges2013ARCMP,
	abstract = { Strong electronic correlations are often associated with the proximity of a Mott-insulating state. In recent years however, it has become increasingly clear that the Hund's rule coupling (intra-atomic exchange) is responsible for strong correlations in multiorbital metallic materials that are not close to a Mott insulator. Hund's coupling has two effects: It influences the energetics of the Mott gap and strongly suppresses the coherence scale for the formation of a Fermi liquid. A global picture has emerged recently, which emphasizes the importance of the average occupancy of the shell as a control parameter. The most dramatic effects occur away from half-filling or single occupancy. We review the theoretical understanding and physical properties of these Hund's metals, together with the relevance of this concept to transition-metal oxides (TMOs) of the 3d, and especially 4d, series (such as ruthenates), as well as to the iron-based superconductors (iron pnictides and chalcogenides). },

@article{Hashimoto2014NPa,
	abstract = {The spectral energy gap is an important signature that defines states of quantum matter: insulators, density waves and superconductors have very different gap structures. The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition-temperature (Tc) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome. These results provide us with microscopic insights into the cuprate phase diagram.},

	abstract = {Weyl semimetals are recently predicted class of materials that can be regarded as three-dimensional analogs of graphene breaking time reversal or inversion symmetry. Electrons in a Weyl semimetal behave as Weyl fermions, which have many exotic properties, such as chiral anomaly and magnetic monopoles in the crystal momentum space. The surface state of a Weyl semimetal displays pairs of entangled Fermi arcs at two opposite surfaces. However, the existence of Weyl semimetals has not yet been proved experimentally.

We performed angle-resolved microwave transmission measurements through a double-gyroid photonic crystal with inversion-breaking where Weyl points have been theoretically predicted to occur.

	abstract = {Weyl semimetal is a new quantum state of matter [1-12] hosting the condensed matter physics counterpart of relativisticWeyl fermion [13] originally introduced in high energy physics. The Weyl semimetal realized in the TaAs class features multiple Fermi arcs arising from topological surface states [10, 11, 14-16] and exhibits novel quantum phenomena, e.g., chiral anomaly induced negative mag-netoresistance [17-19] and possibly emergent supersymmetry [20]. Recently it was proposed theoretically that a new type (type-II) of Weyl fermion [21], which does not have counterpart in high energy physics due to the breaking of Lorentz invariance, can emerge as topologically-protected touching between electron and hole pockets. Here, we report direct spectroscopic evidence of topological Fermi arcs in the predicted type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2 [22-24]. The topological surface states are confirmed by directly observing the surface states using bulk-and surface-sensitive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and the quasi-particle interference (QPI) pattern between the two putative Fermi arcs in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our work establishes MoTe2 as the first experimental realization of type-II Weyl semimetal, and opens up new opportunities for probing novel phenomena such as exotic magneto-transport [21] in type-II Weyl semimetals.},

This code is mainly designed to be used with the TRIQS library in order to solve the self-consistent quantum impurity problem in a multi-orbital dynamical mean field theory approach to strongly-correlated electrons, in particular in the context of realistic electronic structure calculations. It is implemented in C++ for efficiency and is provided with a high-level Python interface. The code ships with a new partitioning algorithm that divides the local Hilbert space without any user knowledge of the symmetries and quantum numbers of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we implement higher-order configuration moves and show that such moves are necessary to ensure ergodicity of the Monte Carlo in common Hamiltonians even without symmetry-breaking.

	abstract = {Quantum spin liquids may be considered `quantum disordered' ground states of spin systems, in which zero-point fluctuations are so strong that they prevent conventional magnetic long-range order. More interestingly, quantum spin liquids are prototypical examples of ground states with massive many-body entanglement, which is of a degree sufficient to render these states distinct phases of matter. Their highly entangled nature imbues quantum spin liquids with unique physical aspects, such as non-local excitations, topological properties, and more. In this review, we discuss the nature of such phases and their properties based on paradigmatic models and general arguments, and introduce theoretical technology such as gauge theory and partons, which are conveniently used in the study of quantum spin liquids. An overview is given of the different types of quantum spin liquids and the models and theories used to describe them. We also provide a guide to the current status of experiments in relation to study quantum spin liquids, and to the diverse probes used therein.},

	abstract = {The dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps a correlated lattice problem onto an impurity problem of a single correlated site coupled to an uncorrelated bath. Most implementations solve the DMFT equations using quantum Monte-Carlo sampling on the imaginary time and frequency (Matsubara) axis. We will here review alternative methods using exact diagonalization, i.e., representing the many-body ground state of the impurity as a sum over Slater determinants and calculating Green's functions using iterative Lanczos procedures. The advantage being that these methods have no sign problem, can handle involved multi-orbital Hamiltonians (low crystal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling) and --when working completely on the real axis --do not need a mathematically ill-posed analytical continuation. The disadvantage of traditional implementations of exact diagonalization has been the exponential scaling of the calculation problem as a function of number of bath discretization points. In the last part we will review how recent advances in exact diagonalization can evade the exponential barrier thereby increasing the number of bath discretization points to reach the thermodynamic limit.},

	n2 = {Weyl semimetals carry the promise of quantum electronic applications. Theoretical calculations have suggested that Luttinger semimetals recently found in iridium oxides may be a suitable group of materials where such topological phases, including Weyl semimetal state, may be found. For example, praseodymium-iridium oxide, Pr2Ir2O7, is one such Luttinger semimetal that can be tuned by perturbations such as strain into a Weyl semimetal state. Despite theoretical predictions of Weyl semimetal states in Pr2Ir2O7 crystals, experimental proof remains elusive due to the difficulty of applying sufficient mechanical strain on single crystals. Our study provides strong experimental evidence that a Weyl semimetal state may indeed appear in strained pyrochlore iridium oxide films, opening a way to explore topological phases.Pyrochlore iridates have provided a plethora of novel phenomena owing to the combination of topology and correlation. Among them, much attention has been paid to Pr2Ir2O7, as it is known as a Luttinger semimetal characterized by quadratic band touching at the Brillouin zone center, suggesting that the topology of its electronic states can be tuned by a moderate lattice strain and external magnetic field. Here, we report that our epitaxial Pr2Ir2O7 thin films grown by solid-state epitaxy exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect that persists up to 50 K without having spontaneous magnetization within our experimental accuracy. This indicates that the system breaks the time reversal symmetry at a temperature scale that is too high for the magnetism to be due to Pr 4f moments and must be related to magnetic order of the iridium 5d electrons. Moreover, our analysis finds that the chiral anomaly induces the negative contribution to the magnetoresistance only when a magnetic field and the electric current are parallel to each other. Our results indicate that the strained part of the thin film forms a magnetic Weyl semimetal state.},

By revealing the spatiotemporal behavior from all observed Bragg diffractions in 3D, the femtosecond primary vanadium-vanadium bond dilation, the displacements of atoms in picoseconds, and the sound wave shear motion on hundreds of picoseconds were resolved, elucidating the nature of the structural pathways and the nonconcerted mechanism of the transformation.},

We report on combined ultrafast electron diffraction and infrared transmissivity experiments in which we directly monitored and separated the lattice and charge density reorganizations that are associated with the optically induced semiconductor-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2). By photoexciting the monoclinic semiconducting phase, we were able to induce a transition to a metastable state that retained the periodic lattice distortion characteristic of the semiconductor but also acquired metal-like mid-infrared optical properties. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast electron diffraction is capable of following details of both lattice and electronic structural dynamics on the ultrafast time scale.},

	abstract = {We have developed a low temperature ultrahigh resolution system for polarization dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) using a vacuum ultraviolet (vuv) laser (hnu=6.994 eV) as a photon source. With the aim of addressing low energy physics, we show the system performance with angle-integrated PES at the highest energy resolution of 360 mueV and the lowest temperature of 2.9 K. We describe the importance of a multiple-thermal-shield design for achieving the low temperature, which allows a clear measurement of the superconducting gap of tantalum metal with a T(c)=4.5 K. The unique specifications and quality of the laser source (narrow linewidth of 260 mueV, high photon flux), combined with a half-wave plate, facilitates ultrahigh energy and momentum resolution polarization dependent ARPES. We demonstrate the use of s- and p-polarized laser-ARPESs in studying the superconducting gap on bilayer-split bands of a high T(c) cuprate. The unique features of the quasi-continuous-wave vuv laser and low temperature enables ultrahigh-energy and -momentum resolution studies of the spectral function of a solid with large escape depth. We hope the present work helps in defining polarization dependent laser excited angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy as a frontier tool for the study of electronic structure and properties of materials at the sub-meV energy scale.},

Coupled with the available sub-10 fs optical pulses, investigations into few-femtosecond dynamics are not far off. However, achieving sufficient synchro- nization between optical lasers and X-ray pulses continues to be challenging.We report a `measure-and-sort' approach, which achieves sub-10 fs root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) error measure- ment at hard X-ray FELs, far beyond the 100--200 fs r.m.s. jitter limitations. This timing diagnostic, now routinely available at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), is based on ultrafast free-carrier generation in optically transparent materials. Correlation between two independent measurements enables unambiguous demonstration of ∼6 fs r.m.s. error in reporting the optical/X-ray delay, with single shot error suggesting the possibility of reaching few-femtosecond resolution.},

The result is not consistent with an explanation by nesting properties. Based on the theoretically predicted modifications of the ground-state spin texture of a strongly warped Dirac cone, we propose spin-dependent scattering processes as explanation for the anisotropic scattering rates.

Measurements and anisotropy of intrinsic transport and magnetic properties from high-quality single crystal are first presented. The resistivity anisotropy (rho{\{}c{\}}/rho{\{}ab{\}}) is as large as 150 and independent of temperature. In contrast to the susceptibility behavior observed in polycrystalline samples, no Curie-Weiss behavior is observed, and a linear-T dependent susceptibility occurs from the spin-density-wave transition temperature, (T{\{}s{\}}), to 700 K. This result suggests that strong antiferromagnetic correlations are present well above T{\{}s{\}}. A twofold symmetry of susceptibility in the ab plane indicates a stripelike spin structure as observed by neutron scattering. The resistivity minimum is strongly dependent on the magnetic field, suggesting that the upturn of the resistivity at low temperatures should be related to spin fluctuation.},

	abstract = {The material class of rare earth nickelates with high Ni3+ oxidation state is generating continued interest due to the occurrence of a metal-insulator transition with charge order and the appearance of non-collinear magnetic phases within this insulating regime. The recent theoretical prediction for superconductivity in LaNiO3 thin films has also triggered intensive research efforts. LaNiO3 seems to be the only rare earth nickelate that stays metallic and paramagnetic down to lowest temperatures. So far, centimeter-sized impurity-free single crystal growth has not been reported for the rare earth nickelates material class since elevated oxygen pressures are required for their synthesis. Here, we report on the successful growth of centimeter-sized LaNiO3 single crystals by the floating zone technique at oxygen pressures of up to 150 bar. Our crystals are essentially free from Ni2+ impurities and exhibit metallic properties together with an unexpected but clear antiferromagnetic transition.},

Within R-DMFT, antiferromagnetic order is found to be stable in spatial regions with total particle density close to one, but persists also in parts of the system where the local density significantly deviates from half filling. In systems with spin imbalance, we find that antiferromagnetism is gradually suppressed and phase separation emerges beyond a critical value of the spin imbalance.},

This material differs from other tetradymites studied as topological insulators due to the increased ionic character that arises from its significant S content. Bi2Te1.6S1.4 forms high quality crystals from the melt and is the S-rich limit of the ternary Bi-Te-S gamma-tetradymite phase at the melting point. The native material is n type with a low resistivity; Sb substitution, and with adjustment of the Te to S ratio, results in a crossover to p type and resistive behavior at low temperatures. An angle-resolved photoemission study shows that topological surface states are present, with the Dirac point more exposed than it is in Bi2Te3 and similar to that seen in Bi2Te2Se. Single crystal structure determination indicates that the S in the outer chalcogen layers is closer to the Bi than the Te, and therefore that the layers supporting the surface states are corrugated on the atomic scale.},

The phenomenon is discussed in many contexts in particle, nuclear and astro- physics but direct tests of the Klein paradox using elementary particles have so far proved impossible. Here we show that the effect can be tested in a conceptually simple condensed-matter experiment by using electrostatic barriers in single- and bi-layer graphene. Due to the chiral nature of their quasiparticles, quantum tunneling in these materials becomes highly anisotropic, qualitatively different from the case of normal, nonrelativistic electrons. Massless Dirac fermions in graphene allow a close realization of Klein's gedanken experiment whereas massive chiral fermions in bilayer graphene offer an interesting complementary system that elucidates the basic physics involved.},

Our data show that photoexcited electrons reach an internal thermalization within 300 fs of the arrival of the pump pulse. Instead, the dichroic contrast generated by the circularly polarized light relaxes on a time scale shorter than 80 fs. This result implies that orbital and spin polarization created by the circular pump pulse rapidly decays via manybody interaction. The persistent dichroism at longer delay times is due to the helicity dependence of superdiffussive transport. We ascribe it to the lack of inversion symmetry in an electronic system far from equilibrium conditions.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal is the 3D analog of graphene whose bulk band shows a linear dispersion relation in the 3D momentum space. Since each Dirac point with four-fold degeneracy carries a zero Chern number, a Dirac semimetal can be stable only in the presence of certain crystalline symmetries. In this work, we propose a general framework to classify stable 3D Dirac semimetals. Based on symmetry analysis, we show that various types of stable 3D Dirac semimetals exist in systems having the time-reversal, inversion, and uniaxial rotational symmetries. There are two distinct classes of stable 3D Dirac semimetals. In the first class, a pair of 3D Dirac points locate on the rotation axis, away from its center. Moreover, the 3D Dirac semimetals in this class have nontrivial topological properties characterized by 2D topological invariants, such as the {\$}Z{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} invariant or the mirror Chern number. These 2D topological indices give rise to stable 2D surface Dirac cones, which can be deformed to Fermi arcs when the surface states couple to the bulk states on the Fermi level. On the other hand, the second class of Dirac SM phases possess a 3D Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum (TRIM) on the rotation axis and do not have surface states in general.},

	abstract = {Intense femtosecond (10(-15) s) light pulses can be used to transform electronic, magnetic and structural order in condensed-matter systems on timescales of electronic and atomic motion. This technique is particularly useful in the study and in the control of materials whose physical properties are governed by the interactions between multiple degrees of freedom. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in this context a direct and comprehensive, energy- and momentum-selective probe of the ultrafast processes that couple to the electronic degrees of freedom. Previously, the capability of such studies to access electron momentum space away from zero momentum was, however, restricted owing to limitations of the available probing photon energy. Here, using femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by a high-harmonic-generation source, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the photoinduced vaporization of a charge-ordered state in the potential excitonic insulator 1T-TiSe(2 )(refs 12, 13). By way of stroboscopic imaging of electronic band dispersions at large momentum, in the vicinity of the edge of the first Brillouin zone, we reveal that the collapse of atomic-scale periodic long-range order happens on a timescale as short as 20 femtoseconds. The surprisingly fast response of the system is assigned to screening by the transient generation of free charge carriers. Similar screening scenarios are likely to be relevant in other photoinduced solid-state transitions and may generally determine the response times. Moreover, as electron states with large momenta govern fundamental electronic properties in condensed matter systems, we anticipate that the experimental advance represented by the present study will be useful to study the ultrafast dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of electronic phenomena in a wide range of materials.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator, but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. The 2D topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A 3D topological insulator supports novel spin polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium article we will review the theoretical foundation for these electronic states and describe recent experiments in which their signatures have been observed. We will describe transport experiments on HgCdTe quantum wells that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. We will then discuss experiments on Bi{\$}{\_}{\{}1-x{\}}{\$}Sb{\$}{\_}x{\$}, Bi{\$}{\_}2{\$}Se{\$}{\_}3{\$}, Bi{\$}{\_}2{\$}Te{\$}{\_}3{\$} and Sb{\$}{\_}2{\$}Te{\$}{\_}3{\$} that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. We will then describe exotic states that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions, and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. We will close by discussing prospects for observing these exotic states, a well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

	abstract = {Abstract The metal-insulator transition for donors in a semiconductor is examined in the light of the work of Kohn on the nature of the transition. Kohn's work predicts, for a rigid crystalline lattice, an infinite series of second-order transitions as the interatomic distance approaches the transition point. The original work of Mott on the transition suggested that it should be of the first order with a discontinuous change in the number of free electrons at T=0, unless the dielectric constant k could be shown to tend to infinity at the transition point. In this paper it is suggested that Kohn's theory may allow this to occur. The evidence from the behaviour of doped semiconductors is analysed; in this case the effect of the random (non-crystalline) distribution of the centres must be allowed for. It is suggested that Kohn's charge density waves must be replaced by random fluctuations of charge density, occurring near the transition point and due, as is the transition, to electron-electron interaction. The possibility that k should tend to infinity exists here as in Kohn's model. It appears therefore that the random distribution of the centres does not change the nature of the transition in any essential way, and that it is second order in either case. The experimental work of Davis and Compton (1965) on the effect of compensation on the activation energies for conduction near the transition point in antimony-doped germanium is examined in the light of the model proposed. The most striking result is that the concentration of centres at which the transition occurs is almost independent of compensation. An explanation of this is suggested. Another unexpected result is that, in the metallic region where the concentration of centres is high, a small activation energy remains if the compensation K is large. It is suggested that in this case the one-electron wave-functions of electrons near the Fermi energy are localized, due to strong scattering by the charged acceptors, and it is shown that this is bound to occur if K is large enough.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2), an archetypal correlated oxide compound, undergoes a temperature-driven metal-insulator transition near room temperature with a concomitant change in crystal symmetry. Here, we show that the metal-insulator transition temperature of thin VO2(001) films can be changed continuously from [sim]285 to [sim]345[thinsp]K by varying the thickness of the RuO2 buffer layer (resulting in different epitaxial strains). Using strain-, polarization- and temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and electronic transport measurements, we demonstrate that the transition temperature and the structural distortion across the transition depend on the orbital occupancy in the metallic state. Our findings open up the possibility of controlling the conductivity in atomically thin VO2 layers by manipulating the orbital occupancy by, for example, heterostructural engineering.},

	abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are an emergent class of metamaterials comprised of vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) building blocks, which provide us with a vast tool set to engineer their properties on top of the already rich tunability of 2D materials. One of the knobs, the twist angle between different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic properties of a vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other systems such as MBE-grown semiconductor heterostructures. For small twist angles, the moir$\backslash$'e pattern produced by the lattice misorientation creates a long-range modulation. So far, the study of the effect of twist angles in vdW heterostructures has been mostly concentrated in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) twisted structures, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction due to the presence of a large bandgap in h-BN. Here we show that when two graphene sheets are twisted by an angle close to the theoretically predicted 'magic angle', the resulting flat band structure near charge neutrality gives rise to a strongly-correlated electronic system. These flat bands exhibit half-filling insulating phases at zero magnetic field, which we show to be a Mott-like insulator arising from electrons localized in the moir$\backslash$'e superlattice. These unique properties of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TwBLG) open up a new playground for exotic many-body quantum phases in a 2D platform made of pure carbon and without magnetic field. The easy accessibility of the flat bands, the electrical tunability, and the bandwidth tunability though twist angle may pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors or quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of the first Weyl semimetal in TaAs provides the first observation of a Weyl fermion in nature and demonstrates a novel type of anomalous surface state, the Fermi arc. Like topological insulators, the bulk topological invariants of a Weyl semimetal are uniquely fixed by the surface states of a bulk sample. Here, we present a set of distinct conditions, accessible by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), each of which demonstrates topological Fermi arcs in a surface state band structure, with minimal reliance on calculation. We apply these results to TaAs and NbP. For the first time, we rigorously demonstrate a non-zero Chern number in TaAs by counting chiral edge modes on a closed loop. We further show that it is unreasonable to directly observe Fermi arcs in NbP by ARPES within available experimental resolution and spectral linewidth. Our results are general and apply to any new material to demonstrate a Weyl semimetal.},

	abstract = {The theory of second-order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed-matter theory. A central concept is the observable order parameter, whose nonzero average value characterizes one or more phases. At large distances and long times, fluctuations of the order parameter(s) are described by a continuum field theory, and these dominate the physics near such phase transitions. We show that near second-order quantum phase transitions, subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm, and we present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets. The critical points separate phases characterized by conventional ``confining'' order parameters. Nevertheless, the critical theory contains an emergent gauge field and ``deconfined'' degrees of freedom associated with fractionalization of the order parameters. We propose that this paradigm for quantum criticality may be the key to resolving a number of experimental puzzles in correlated electron systems and offer a new perspective on the properties of complex materials.},

This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.},

The position is derived from the relative intensity of the four diodes, while the sum provides beam intensity information. In contrast to traditional synchrotron beam monitors, where diodes measure a DC current signal, the LCLS beam monitors have to cope with the pulsed nature of the FEL, which requires a large single shot dynamic range. A key component of these beam monitors is the readout electronics. The first generation of beam monitors showed some limitations. A new scheme with upgraded electronics, firmware and software was implemented resulting in a more robust and reliable measuring tool.},

Here, we show with angle resolved photoemission studies supported by $\backslash$textit{\{}ab initio{\}} calculations that the highly stable, non-toxic and earth-abundant material, ZrSiS, has an electronic band structure that hosts several Dirac cones which form a Fermi surface with a diamond-shaped line of Dirac nodes. We also experimentally show, for the first time, that the square Si lattice in ZrSiS is an excellent template for realizing the new types of 2D Dirac cones recently predicted by Young and Kane $\backslash$cite{\{}young2015dirac{\}} and image an unforseen surface state that arises close to the 2D Dirac cone. Finally, we find that the energy range of the linearly dispersed bands is as high as 2$\backslash$,eV above and below the Fermi level; much larger than of any known Dirac material so far. This makes ZrSiS a very promising candidate to study the exotic behavior of Dirac electrons, or Weyl fermions if a magnetic field is applied, as well as the properties of lines of Dirac nodes},

The proposed topological semimetals are characterized by the presence of bulk one-dimensional (1D) Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs) and two-dimensional (2D) nearly-flat surface states, protected by inversion and time--reversal symmetries. We develop the {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\$} invariants dictating the presence of DLNs based on parity eigenvalues at the parity--invariant points in reciprocal space.

	abstract = {A wide range of materials, like d-wave superconductors, graphene, and topological insulators, share a fundamental similarity: their low-energy fermionic excitations behave as massless Dirac particles rather than fermions obeying the usual Schrodinger Hamiltonian. This emergent behavior of Dirac fermions in condensed matter systems defines the unifying framework for a class of materials we call "Dirac materials''. In order to establish this class of materials, we illustrate how Dirac fermions emerge in multiple entirely different condensed matter systems and we discuss how Dirac fermions have been identified experimentally using electron spectroscopy techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). As a consequence of their common low-energy excitations, this diverse set of materials shares a significant number of universal properties in the low-energy (infrared) limit. We review these common properties including nodal points in the excitation spectrum, density of states, specific heat, transport, thermodynamic properties, impurity resonances, and magnetic field responses, as well as discuss many-body interaction effects. We further review how the emergence of Dirac excitations is controlled by specific symmetries of the material, such as time-reversal, gauge, and spin-orbit symmetries, and how by breaking these symmetries a finite Dirac mass is generated. We give examples of how the interaction of Dirac fermions with their distinct real material background leads to rich novel physics with common fingerprints such as the suppression of back scattering and impurity-induced resonant states.},

Including spin, the low energy effective theory around each critical point is a four band Dirac Hamiltonian. In two dimensions (2D), this situation is realized in graphene without spin-orbit coupling. 3D Dirac points are predicted to exist at the phase transition between a topological and a normal insulator in the presence of inversion symmetry. Here we show that 3D Dirac points can also be protected by crystallographic symmetries in particular space-groups and enumerate the criteria necessary to identify these groups. This reveals the possibility of 3D analogs to graphene. We provide a systematic approach for identifying such materials and present ab initio calculations of metastable $\backslash$beta-cristobalite BiO{\_}2 which exhibits Dirac points at the three symmetry related X points of the BZ.},

Using a two-site tight-binding model, we construct representatives of three possible distinct Dirac semimetal phases, and show that single symmetry-protected Dirac points are impossible in two dimensions.

This behavior is in qualitative agreement with Landau's theory of Fermi liquids, but the data show deviations from the behavior of a common three-dimensional degenerate electron gas. Concerning electron-phonon interaction, our data allows us to directly observe the coupling of Bloch states to the coherent A1g mode. It is found that surface states are much less coupled to this mode when compared to bulk states. This is confirmed by ab initio calculations of surface and bulk bismuth.},

It is now widely agreed that the unusual magnetic properties can be explained by taking both orbital and spin degrees of freedom into account. Whereas many experiments give direct information on the magnetic structure, only indirect evidence suggests the existence of orbital order in cases like V2O3, where it is not accompanied by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion. We have demonstrated the existence of orbital ordering in V2O3by means of X-ray resonant scattering at the vanadium K-edge using tunable synchrotron radiation. The observed orbital structure confirms the interplay between orbital and magnetic order, and provides an illustration of a new experimental method to extract information on the electronic orbital occupancy in solids.},

	abstract = {The electronic transport properties of conventional three-dimen- sional metals are successfully described by Fermi-liquid theory. But when the dimensionality of such a system is reduced to one, the Fermi-liquid state becomes unstable to Coulomb inter- actions, and the conduction electrons should instead behave according to Tomonaga--Luttinger-liquid (TLL) theory. Such a state reveals itself through interaction-dependent anomalous exponents in the correlation functions, density of states and momentum distribution of the electrons1--3 walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are considered to be ideal one-dimensional systems for realizing TLL states4--6 the results of transport measurements on metal--SWNT and SWNT--SWNT junctions have been attributed7--9 to the effects of tunnelling into or between TLLs, although there remains some ambiguity in these interpretations10 . Direct observations of the electronic states in SWNTs are therefore needed to resolve these uncertainties. Here we report angle-integrated photoemission measurements of SWNTs. Our results reveal an oscillation in the p-electron density of states owing to one-dimensional van Hove singularities, confirming the one-dimensional nature of the valence band. The spectral function and intensities at the Fermi level both exhibit power-law behaviour (with almost identical exponents) in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the TLL state in SWNTs.},

Harvesting energy from excited electron-hole pairs, for instance, is only possible if these pairs can be separated before they lose energy to vibrations, merely heating the lattice. Until now, the hot carrier dynamics in graphene could only be accessed indirectly. Here, we present a dynamical view on the Dirac cone by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This allows us to show the quasi-instant thermalization of the electron gas to a temperature of ≈2000 K, to determine the time-resolved carrier density, and to disentangle the subsequent decay into excitations of optical phonons and acoustic phonons (directly and via supercollisions). {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

We use these transitions in order to track the effects of space-charge on the spectra in view of pump-probe experiments, at high excitations densities. A simple model is presented, which reproduces the measured energy shifts and broadenings in great detail, allowing the ultrafast dynamics and the space-charge effects to be disentangled. Moreover, owing to the high excitation densities an additional particular three-photon transition via both the interface state and a virtual intermediate state could be measured and identified. The polarization-dependent transient of this transition has successfully been simulated, allowing the lifetime of the involved intermediate state to be extracted from the data.},

Recent experiments have shown that the high-temperature incommensurate (I) charge density wave (CDW) phase of 1T-TaS2 can be photoinduced from the lower-temperature, nearly commensurate CDW state. Here we report a time-resolved x-ray diffraction study of the growth process of the photoinduced I-CDW domains. The layered nature of the material results in a marked anisotropy in the size of the photoinduced domains of the I-phase. These are found to grow self-similarly, their shape remaining unchanged throughout the growth process. The photoinduced dynamics of the newly formed I-CDW phase was probed at various stages of the growth process using a double pump scheme, where a first pump creates I-CDW domains and a second pump excites the newly formed I-CDW state. We observe larger magnitudes of the coherently excited I-CDW amplitude mode in smaller domains, which suggests that the incommensurate lattice distortion is less stable for smaller domain sizes.},

@article{Lee2006RMP,
	abstract = {This article reviews the physics of high-temperature superconductors from the point of view of the doping of a Mott insulator. The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Anderson's idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the thermal excitation of quasiparticles. However, an argument is made that phase fluctuations can only explain pseudogap phenomenology over a limited temperature range, and some additional physics is needed to explain the onset of singlet formation at very high temperatures. A description of the numerical method of the projected wave function is presented, which turns out to be a very useful technique for implementing the strong correlation constraint and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the resonating valence bond idea on a more formal footing. The slave boson is introduced to enforce the constraint againt double occupation and it is shown that the implementation of this local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. This review follows the historical order by first examining the U(1) formulation of the gauge theory. Some inadequacies of this formulation for underdoping are discussed, leading to the SU(2) formulation. Here follows a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin-liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. The difference between the high-energy gauge group in the formulation of the problem versus the low-energy gauge group, which is an emergent phenomenon, is emphasized. Several possible routes to deconfinement based on different emergent gauge groups are discussed, which leads to the physics of fractionalization and spin-charge separation. Next the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping is described with a focus on a part of the mean-field phase diagram called the staggered flux liquid phase. It will be shown that inclusion of the gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase. It is emphasized that d-wave superconductivity can be considered as evolving from a stable U(1) spin liquid. These ideas are applied to the high-Tc cuprates, and their implications for the vortex structure and the phase diagram are discussed. A possible test of the topological structure of the pseudogap phase is described.},

	abstract = {We present high resolution angle resolved photoemission data of the bilayer superconductor Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta) (Bi2212) showing a clear doubling of the near E(F) bands. This splitting approaches zero along the (0,0)--{\textgreater}(pi,pi) nodal line and is not observed in single layer Bi(2)Sr(2)CuO(6+delta) (Bi2201), indicating that the splitting is due to the long sought after bilayer splitting effect. The splitting has a magnitude of approximately 75 meV near the middle of the zone, extrapolating to about 110 meV near the (pi,0) point. The existence of these two bands also helps to clear up the recent controversy concerning the topology of the Fermi surface.},

	abstract = {We investigate a quarter-filled two-band Hubbard model involving a crystal-field splitting, which lifts the orbital degeneracy as well as an inter-orbital hopping (inter-band hybridization). Both terms are relevant to the realistic description of correlated materials such as transition-metal oxides. The nature of the Mott metal-insulator transition is clarified and is found to depend on the magnitude of the crystal-field splitting. At large values of the splitting, a transition from a two-band to a one-band metal is first found as the on-site repulsion is increased and is followed by a Mott transition for the remaining band, which follows the single-band (Brinkman-Rice) scenario well documented previously within dynamical mean-field theory. At small values of the crystal-field splitting, a direct transition from a two-band metal to a Mott insulator with partial orbital polarization is found, which takes place simultaneously for both orbitals. This transition is characterized by a vanishing of the quasiparticle weight for the majority orbital but has a first-order character for the minority orbital. It is pointed out that finite-temperature effects may easily turn the metallic regime into a bad metal close to the orbital polarization transition in the metallic phase.},

In particular, we discuss how photodoping leads to doublon and hole populations with different effective temperatures, and we analyze the relaxation behavior as a function of the boson coupling and boson energy. In the polaronic regime, the nontrivial energy exchange between doublons, holes and bosons can result in a negative temperature distribution for the holes.},

We show that, despite the shrinking of the Fermi surfaces with respect to first-principle calculations, the charge-carrier concentration in each band is almost unchanged, with a substantial conservation of the total optical sum rule. However, a significant transfer of spectral weight occurs from low-energy coherent processes to incoherent ones, with practical consequences on the experimental estimate of the sum rule, that is carried out integrating the data up to a finite cut-off. This has profound consequences both on the absolute value of the sum rule and on its temperature dependence, that must be taken into account while discussing optical experiments in these systems.},

For 0{\textless}=x{\textless}=0.005 a metal-insulator transition is encountered at 150-170 K which coincides with the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering. Above room temperature there is a gradual transition to a second metallic phase. The resistivity of the metallic phase at a fixed temperature increases by three orders of magnitude on changing the Cr content from 0 to 1.8 at.{\%}, while the Seebeck coefficient remains virtually unaltered. For fixed alloy composition 0.005{\textless}x{\textless}0.018, increasing temperature produces three transitions: The alloy is an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) at low temperatures, a metal (M) at intermediate temperatures, a paramagnetic insulator (I) at higher temperature, and then reverts back to a quasimetallic state (M') at elevated temperatures. The M-I transformation is accompanied by unusually large hysteresis effects. For 0.018{\textless}=x{\textless}=0.1 only the AFI, I, and M' phases are encountered. These findings can be accounted for in a semiempirical manner in terms of a Fermi level for the M phase that intersects a local minimum in the density of states, which deepens further and ultimately gives rise to a band gap, either as x is increased past the critical value of 0.0177 at fixed temperature T, or as T is changed at constant x. The band gap, generated when the I phase appears, is probably due to a Hubbard-type transition that is strongly affected by electron-phonon interactions; it then closes self-consistently with a further increase in T. The band gap obtained on cooling is associated with the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering. The generally accepted phase diagram for the system has been amended to include the existence above 450 K of another phase (M') which is either a metal or a highly degenerate semiconductor.},

The focus is on the interaction between instrumental development and scientific achievements. In particular the opportunities provided by the increasingly brilliant synchrotron radiation sources are discussed. The contribution is focused on core level studies. The recent development is demonstrated by using selected examples obtained at today's most advanced synchrotron radiation facilities. The spectral resolution and intensity that can be reached at these facilities reveal new effects and provide detailed information on the investigated systems. The examples are mainly taken from studies of atoms and molecules where different effects can be most accurately identified and separated.},

@article{Sciaini2009N,
	abstract = {The development of X-ray and electron diffraction methods with ultrahigh time resolution has made it possible to map directly, at the atomic level, structural changes in solids induced by laser excitation. This has resulted in unprecedented insights into the lattice dynamics of solids undergoing phase transitions. In aluminium, for example, femtosecond optical excitation hardly affects the potential energy surface of the lattice; instead, melting of the material is governed by the transfer of thermal energy between the excited electrons and the initially cold lattice. In semiconductors, in contrast, exciting approximately 10 per cent of the valence electrons results in non-thermal lattice collapse owing to the antibonding character of the conduction band. These different material responses raise the intriguing question of how Peierls-distorted systems such as bismuth will respond to strong excitations. The evolution of the atomic configuration of bismuth upon excitation of its A(1g) lattice mode, which involves damped oscillations of atoms along the direction of the Peierls distortion of the crystal, has been probed, but the actual melting of the material has not yet been investigated. Here we present a femtosecond electron diffraction study of the structural changes in crystalline bismuth as it undergoes laser-induced melting. We find that the dynamics of the phase transition depend strongly on the excitation intensity, with melting occurring within 190 fs (that is, within half a period of the unperturbed A(1g) lattice mode) at the highest excitation. We attribute the surprising speed of the melting process to laser-induced changes in the potential energy surface of the lattice, which result in strong acceleration of the atoms along the longitudinal direction of the lattice and efficient coupling of this motion to an unstable transverse vibrational mode. That is, the atomic motions in crystalline bismuth can be electronically accelerated so that the solid-to-liquid phase transition occurs on a sub-vibrational timescale.},

Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

We discuss the case of the model system VO2, a prototypical non-magnetic compound that exhibits cell doubling, charge localization and a metal-insulator transition below 340 K. We initiate the formation of the metallic phase by prompt hole photo-doping into the valence band of the low-T insulator. The I-M transition is however delayed with respect to hole injection, exhibiting a bottleneck timescale that corresponds to half period of the phonon connecting the two crystallographic phases. This experiment indicates that this controversial insulator may have important band-like character.},

We compare these with previously reported results for resistivity and thermopower. Temperature-dependent features indicating transitions (or crossovers) are correlated among the various experimental quantities. Taking into account recent spectroscopic studies, we argue that the most likely interpretation of the complete collection of results is that an unusual form of two-dimensional superconducting correlations appears together with the onset of spin-stripe order. Recent theoretical proposals for a sinusoidally-modulated superconducting state compatible with stripe order provide an intriguing explanation of our results and motivate further experimental tests. We also discuss evidence for one-dimensional pairing correlations that appear together with the charge order. With regard to the overall phenomenology, we consider the degree to which similar behavior may have been observed in other cuprates, and describe possible connections to various puzzling phenomena in cuprate superconductors.},

@article{Zhang2005N,
	abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

	abstract = {The interaction of light with a material's electronic system creates an out-of-equilibrium (non-thermal) distribution of optically excited electrons. Non-equilibrium dynamics relaxes this distribution on an ultrafast timescale to a hot Fermi-Dirac distribution with a well-defined temperature. The advent of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) experiments has made it possible to track the decay of the temperature of the excited hot electrons in selected states in the Brillouin zone, and to reveal their cooling in unprecedented detail in a variety of emerging materials. It is, however, not a straightforward task to determine the temperature with high accuracy. This is mainly attributable to an a priori unknown position of the Fermi level and the fact that the shape of the Fermi edge can be severely perturbed when the state in question is crossing the Fermi energy. Here, we introduce a method that circumvents these difficulties and accurately extracts both the temperature and the position of the Fermi level for a hot carrier distribution by tracking the occupation statistics of the carriers measured in a TR-ARPES experiment.},

Based on radiation from electrons accelerated in plasma, these sources have the common properties to be compact and to deliver collimated, incoherent and femtosecond radiation. In this article we review, within a unified formalism, the betatron radiation of trapped and accelerated electrons in the so-called bubble regime, the synchrotron radiation of laser-accelerated electrons in usual meter-scale undulators, the nonlinear Thomson scattering from relativistic electrons oscillating in an intense laser field, and the Thomson backscattered radiation of a laser beam by laser-accelerated electrons. The underlying physics is presented using ideal models, the relevant parameters are defined, and analytical expressions providing the features of the sources are given. Numerical simulations and a summary of recent experimental results on the different mechanisms are also presented. Each section ends with the foreseen development of each scheme. Finally, one of the most promising applications of laser-plasma accelerators is discussed: the realization of a compact free-electron laser in the x-ray range of the spectrum. In the conclusion, the relevant parameters characterizing each sources are summarized. Considering typical laser-plasma interaction parameters obtained with currently available lasers, examples of the source features are given. The sources are then compared to each other in order to define their field of applications.},

@article{Terashima2009PNAS,
	abstract = {The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides raised the possibility of an unconventional superconducting mechanism in multiband materials. The observation of Fermi-surface (FS)-dependent nodeless superconducting gaps suggested that inter-FS interactions may play a crucial role in superconducting pairing. In the optimally hole-doped Ba(0.6)K(0.4)Fe(2)As(2), the pairing strength is enhanced simultaneously (2Delta/T(c) approximately 7) on the nearly nested FS pockets, i.e., the inner hole-like (alpha) FS and the 2 hybridized electron-like FSs, whereas the pairing remains weak (2Delta/T(c) approximately 3.6) in the poorly nested outer hole-like (beta) FS. Here, we report that in the electron-doped BaFe(1.85)Co(0.15)As(2), the FS nesting condition switches from the alpha to the beta FS due to the opposite size changes for hole- and electron-like FSs upon electron doping. The strong pairing strength (2Delta/T(c) approximately 6) is also found to switch to the nested beta FS, indicating an intimate connection between FS nesting and superconducting pairing, and strongly supporting the inter-FS pairing mechanism in the iron-based superconductors.},

Although Dirac fermions are proposed to play a key role in these systems, so far direct experimental evidence of Dirac fermions has been limited. Here we report the first direct observation of massless Dirac fermions with linear dispersion near the Brillouin zone (BZ) corner H in graphite, coexisting with quasiparticles with parabolic dispersion near another BZ corner K. In addition, we report a large electron pocket which we attribute to defect-induced localized states. Thus, graphite presents a novel system where massless Dirac fermions, quasiparticles with finite effective mass, and defect states all contribute to the low energy electronic dynamics.},

	abstract = {The main goal of the book is to provide a systematic and didactic approach to the physics and technology of free-electron lasers. Numerous figures are used for illustrating the underlying ideas and concepts and links to other fields of physics are provided. After an introduction to undulator radiation and the low-gain FEL, the one-dimensional theory of the high-gain FEL is developed in a systematic way. Particular emphasis is put on explaining and justifying the various assumptions and approximations that are needed to obtain the differential and integral equations governing the FEL dynamics. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented and important FEL parameters are defined, such as gain length, FEL bandwidth and saturation power. One of the most important features of a high-gain FEL, the formation of microbunches, is studied at length. The increase of gain length due to beam energy spread, space charge forces, and three-dimensional effects such as betatron oscillations and optical diffraction is analyzed. The mechanism of Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission is described theoretically and illustrated with numerous experimental results. Various methods of FEL seeding by coherent external radiation are introduced, together with experimental results. The world's first soft X-ray FEL, the user facility FLASH at DESY, is described in some detail to give an impression of the complexity of such an accelerator-based light source. The last chapter is devoted to the new hard X-ray FELs which generate extremely intense radiation in the Angstr{\o}m regime. The appendices contain supplementary material and more involved calculations.},

@article{Reid2012SST,
	abstract = {The nature of the pairing state in iron-based superconductors is the subject of much debate. Here we argue that in one material, the stoichiometric iron pnictide KFe2As2, there is overwhelming evidence for a d-wave pairing state, characterized by symmetry-imposed vertical line nodes in the superconducting gap. This evidence is reviewed, with a focus on thermal conductivity and the strong impact of impurity scattering on the critical temperature Tc. We then compare KFe2As2 to Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, obtained by Ba substitution, where the pairing symmetry is s-wave and the Tc is ten times higher. The transition from d-wave to s-wave within the same crystal structure provides a rare opportunity to investigate the connection between band structure and pairing mechanism. We also compare KFe2As2 to the nodal iron-based superconductor LaFePO, for which the pairing symmetry is probably not d-wave, but more likely s-wave with accidental line nodes.},

A 6.28 eV laser source operating at 250 kHz repetition rate is obtained by frequency mixing in nonlinear beta barium borate crystals. This UV light source has a high photon flux of 10(13) photons/s with relatively low number of photons/pulse so that Fermi surface mapping over a wide region of the Brillouin zone is possible while mitigating space charge effects. The UV source has been fully characterized spatially, spectrally, and temporally. Its potential for time and angle-resolved photoemission is demonstrated through Fermi surface mapping and photoexcited electron dynamics in Bismuth. True femtosecond time resolution {\textless}65 fs is obtained while the energy resolution of 70 meV appears to be mainly limited by the laser bandwidth.},

Here, we report the observation of a giant anomalous Nernst effect at room temperature in the full-Heusler ferromagnet Co2MnGa, an order of magnitude larger than the previous maximum value reported for a magnetic conductor3,4. Our numerical and analytical calculations indicate that the proximity to a quantum Lifshitz transition between type-I and type-II magnetic Weyl fermions5--7 is responsible for the observed --Tlog(T) behaviour, with T denoting the temperature, and the enhanced value of the transverse thermoelectric conductivity. The temperature dependence of the thermoelectric response in experiments and numerical calculations can be understood in terms of a quantum critical-scaling function predicted by the low-energy effective theory over more than a decade of temperatures. Moreover, the observation of an unsaturated positive longitudinal magnetoconductance, or chiral anomaly8--10, also provides evidence for the existence of Weyl fermions11,12 in Co2MnGa.},

It is thus highly desired to distinguish the intrinsic characters of the Mott-metal crossover from those of other origins. Here we investigate the evolution of electronic structure and dynamics of the hole-doped pseudospin-1/2 Mott insulator Sr2IrO4. The effective hole doping is achieved by replacing Ir with Rh atoms, with the chemical potential immediately jumping to or near the top of the lower Hubbard band. The doped iridates exhibit multiple iconic low-energy features previously observed in doped cuprates-pseudogaps, Fermi arcs and marginal-Fermi-liquid-like electronic scattering rates. We suggest these signatures are most likely an integral part of the material's proximity to the Mott state, rather than from many of the most claimed mechanisms, including preformed electron pairing, quantum criticality or density-wave formation.},

	abstract = {Heat capacities have been measured for single crystals of V2O3, either pure or doped with 1 and 1.4 mole{\%} Cr2O3 and Al2O3 over the temperature range 100--700$\,^{\circ}$K. V2O3 undergoes a fairly sharp transition at low temperatures (∼170$\,^{\circ}$K) but fails to exhibit any thermal anomaly above 300$\,^{\circ}$K. The thermal behavior of (MxV1−x)2O3, M = Cr, Al, is manifested by two transitions: one at low temperatures, 170--180$\,^{\circ}$K for x = 0.01 and 180--190$\,^{\circ}$K for x = 0.014, and the other at high temperatures. For x = 0.01, the high-temperature (H-T) anomaly extended over the range 325--345$\,^{\circ}$K (Cr-doped V2O3) and 345--365$\,^{\circ}$K (Al-doped V2O3), respectively. The corresponding ranges for x = 0.014 were found to be 260--280$\,^{\circ}$K and 270--290$\,^{\circ}$K, respectively. Further, the H-T anomaly was characterized by a large hysteresis (∼50$\,^{\circ}$K). The values of lattice heat capacity of pure and doped V2O3 were, however, found to be almost the same and could be empirically represented by the Debye (D)−Einstein (E) function with $\theta$ values 430$\,^{\circ}$K (T = 100--230$\,^{\circ}$K) and 465$\,^{\circ}$K (T {\textgreater} 230$\,^{\circ}$K), respectively. Further, the enthalpy change $\Delta$H associated with the H-T anomaly in doped V2O3 (80 ≤ $\Delta$H ≤ 510 J/mole) was 5--10 times smaller than the $\Delta$H corresponding to the lower-temperature transition. The results cited here appear incompatible with the Mott transition model that has been invoked to explain the H-T anomaly.},

To simulate these effects we created several samples and surrounding puck geometries using SimIon 8.0 modeling software, and found that in most cases the system can be approximated by a circular sample mounted on an infinite conducting plane. Experimental measurements of the cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+$\delta$mounted on copper, aluminum, and graphite pucks confirmed the model's accuracy. Both the model and experimental data showed that work-function-induced fields have a significant effect on the outgoing trajectories of electrons for kinetic energies up to six times the work function difference between the sample and the puck. However, with the exception of effects very close to the sample edge, all electric field effects can be taken into account using linear corrections.},

@article{Sundaram2002NM,
	abstract = {Soon after it was discovered that intense laser pulses of nanosecond duration from a ruby laser could anneal the lattice of silicon, it was established that this so-called pulsed laser annealing is a thermal process. Although the radiation energy is transferred to the electrons, the electrons transfer their energy to the lattice on the timescale of the excitation. The electrons and the lattice remain in equilibrium and the laser simply 'heats' the solid to the melting temperature within the duration of the laser pulse. For ultrashort laser pulses in the femtosecond regime, however, thermal processes (which take several picoseconds) and equilibrium thermodynamics cannot account for the experimental data. On excitation with femtosecond laser pulses, the electrons and the lattice are driven far out of equilibrium and disordering of the lattice can occur because the interatomic forces are modified due to the excitation of a large (10{\{}{\%}{\}} or more) fraction of the valence electrons to the conduction band. This review focuses on the nature of the non-thermal transitions in semiconductors under femtosecond laser excitation.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+{\~n}(r), {\~n}/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

Furthermore, we have been able to clarify both the bulk and surface transport channels, establishing a comprehensive understanding of the transport in this material.

We show that there is a k-dependent energy shift compared to density functional calculations, which is large at low Co contents and low temperatures and reduces the volume of hole and electron pockets by a factor 2. This k-shift becomes negligible at high Co content and could be due to interband charge or spin fluctuations. We further reveal that the bands shift with temperature, changing significantly the number of carriers they contain (up to 50{\%}). We explain this evolution by thermal excitations of carriers among the narrow bands, possibly combined with a temperature evolution of the k-dependent fluctuations.},

First applications of this new light source for electron spectroscopy on gas phase helium and xenon demonstrate the selection of a single high harmonic order with the intensity ratio between the selected and its adjacent harmonic not exceeding 10:1.

@article{Suzuki2006B,
	abstract = {Here the physics on the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect is presented. There have been many lecture notes (in Web sites) on the dHvA effect. Many of them have been written by theorists who have no experience on the measurement of the dHvA effect. One of the authors (M.S.) has studied the frequency mixing effect (dHvA) and the static skin effect (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) of bismuth (Bi) as a part of his Ph.D. Thesis (Physics) (University of Tokyo, 1977) under the instruction of Prof. Sei-ichi Tanuma (Ph.D. advisor). Around 1974, Prof. David Shoenberg (the late) visited the University of Tokyo and gave an excellent talk on the dHvA effect of copper at the Physics Colloquium (Prof Ryogo Kubo was also present). When he explained the dHvA period related to the dog's bone, he pronounced it in Japanese, ``inu no hone.'' His talk was very impressive and greatly entertained the audience of the Physics Department. Before his talk, Prof. Shoenberg also visited the Institute of Solid State Physics at the University of Tokyo. At that time, M.S. measured the dHvA effect of copper to examine the possibility of the zone oscillation effect. Prof. Shoenberg gave invaluable suggestions to M.S. on the experiment (unfortunately this experiment has failed) and greatly encouraged M.S. to continue to do the dHvA experiments. This lecture note is written based on the experience of M.S. during his Ph.D. work on the dHvA effect. Note that the pioneering works on the dHvA of Bi were done by Prof. Shoenberg [Proc. Roy. Soc. A 156, 687 (1936), Proc. Roy. Soc. A 156, 701 (1936), Proc. Roy. Soc. A 170, 341 (1936)]. Numerical calculations (although they are very simple calculations) are made by Mathematica 5.2.

	abstract = {The understanding of strongly-correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has puzzled physicists for decades. Such difficulties have stimulated new research paradigms, such as ultra-cold atom lattices for simulating quantum materials. Here we report on the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in a 2D superlattice created by stacking two graphene sheets with a small twist angle. For angles near {\$}1.1{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}, the first `magic' angle, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits ultra-flat bands near charge neutrality, which lead to correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature {\$}T{\_}c{\$} up to 1.7 K. The temperature-density phase diagram shows similarities with that of the cuprates, including superconducting domes. Moreover, quantum oscillations indicate small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating phase, in analogy with under-doped cuprates. The relative high {\$}T{\_}c{\$}, given such small Fermi surface (corresponding to a record-low 2D carrier density of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} \backslashtextrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} , renders TBG among the strongest coupling superconductors, in a regime close to the BCS-BEC crossover. These novel results establish TBG as the first purely carbon-based 2D superconductor and as a highly tunable platform to investigate strongly-correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

@article{Slater1951PR,
	abstract = {The Hartree-Fock equations state that each electron in an atom or molecular system should move in a different potential. In some cases, particularly magnetic cases, this leads to important consequences, since electrons with opposite spins move in different potentials. In particular, in an antiferromagnetic substance, electrons of + and - spin have different potentials; and for an electron of + spin, for instance, the potential energy is lower in those atoms whose spins are pointed in the + direction than in those with the opposite spin. This results in a periodic perturbation of potential, with periodicity twice the atomic periodicity, and leads to a splitting of each energy band in half, with a gap in the middle. In a case where the energy band was half full, resulting in a conductor: when we disregard this effect, the resulting half-band will be just filled when we consider it; this may explain the insulating nature of some antiferromagnetics. A similar argument applied to a diatomic molecule like H2 can result in two alternative types of solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations: one leading to atomic orbitals, the other to molecular orbitals. The solution with atomic orbitals shows an analogy to the antiferromagnetic problem; that with ordinary molecular orbitals shows an analogy to the band theory of a non-magnetic conductor.},

We compute Fermi surfaces and density of states, and find excellent agreement with experiment, substantially improving over standard band-structure methods. Analyzing the QSGW self-energy we discuss non-local and dynamic contributions to effective masses. We present evidence that the two contributions are mostly separable, since the quasi-particle weight is found to be essentially independent of momentum. The main effect of non locality is captured by the static but non-local QSGW effective potential. Moreover, these non-local self-energy corrections, absent in e.g. dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), can be relatively large. We show, on the other hand, that QSGW only partially accounts for dynamic renormalizations at low energies. These findings suggest that QSGW combined with DMFT will capture most of the many-body physics in the iron pnictides and chalcogenides.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast processes can now be studied with the combined atomic spatial resolution of diffraction methods and the temporal resolution of femtosecond optical spectroscopy by using femtosecond pulses of electrons or hard X-rays as structural probes. However, it is challenging to apply these methods to organic materials, which have weak scattering centres, thermal lability, and poor heat conduction. These characteristics mean that the source needs to be extremely bright to enable us to obtain high-quality diffraction data before cumulative heating effects from the laser excitation either degrade the sample or mask the structural dynamics. Here we show that a recently developed, ultrabright femtosecond electron source makes it possible to monitor the molecular motions in the organic salt (EDO-TTF)2PF6 as it undergoes its photo-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition. After the ultrafast laser excitation, we record time-delayed diffraction patterns that allow us to identify hundreds of Bragg reflections with which to map the structural evolution of the system. The data and supporting model calculations indicate the formation of a transient intermediate structure in the early stage of charge delocalization (less than five picoseconds), and reveal that the molecular motions driving its formation are distinct from those that, assisted by thermal relaxation, convert the system into a metallic state on the hundred-picosecond timescale. These findings establish the potential of ultrabright femtosecond electron sources for probing the primary processes governing structural dynamics with atomic resolution in labile systems relevant to chemistry and biology.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structure of the wavefunction is essential for depicting the surface states of a topological insulator. Owing to the inherent strong spin--orbit coupling, the conventional hand-waving picture of the Dirac surface state with a single chiral spin texture is incomplete, as this ignores the orbital components of the Dirac wavefunction and their coupling to the spin textures. Here, by combining orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission experiments and first-principles calculations, we deconvolve the in-plane and out-of-plane p-orbital components of the Dirac wavefunction. The in-plane orbital wavefunction is asymmetric relative to the Dirac point. It is predominantly tangential (radial) to the k-space constant energy surfaces above (below) the Dirac point. This orbital texture switch occurs exactly at the Dirac point, and therefore should be intrinsic to the topological physics. Our results imply that the Dirac wavefunction has a spin--orbital texture---a superposition of orbital wavefunctions coupled with the corresponding spin textures.},

	abstract = {The kagome lattice is a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles known as a platform for exotic quantum magnetic states. Theoretical work has predicted that the kagome lattice may also host Dirac electronic states that could lead to topological and Chern insulating phases, but these have evaded experimental detection to date. Here we study the d-electron kagome metal Fe{\$}{\_}3{\$}Sn{\$}{\_}2{\$} designed to support bulk massive Dirac fermions in the presence of ferromagnetic order. We observe a temperature independent intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity persisting above room temperature suggestive of prominent Berry curvature from the time-reversal breaking electronic bands of the kagome plane. Using angle-resolved photoemission, we discover a pair of quasi-2D Dirac cones near the Fermi level with a 30 meV mass gap that accounts for the Berry curvature-induced Hall conductivity. We show this behavior is a consequence of the underlying symmetry properties of the bilayer kagome lattice in the ferromagnetic state with atomic spin-orbit coupling. This report provides the first evidence for a ferromagnetic kagome metal and an example of emergent topological electronic properties in a correlated electron system. This offers insight into recent discoveries of exotic electronic behavior in kagome lattice antiferromagnets and may provide a stepping stone toward lattice model realizations of fractional topological quantum states.},

	abstract = {Using the newly developed VASP2WANNIER90 interface we have constructed maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) for the e{\_}g states of the prototypical Jahn-Teller magnetic perovskite LaMnO3 at different levels of approximation for the exchange-correlation kernel. These include conventional density functional theory (DFT) with and without additional on-site Hubbard U term, hybrid-DFT, and partially self-consistent GW. By suitably mapping the MLWFs onto an effective e{\_}g tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian we have computed a complete set of TB parameters which should serve as guidance for more elaborate treatments of correlation effects in effective Hamiltonian-based approaches. The method-dependent changes of the calculated TB parameters and their interplay with the electron-electron (el-el) interaction term are discussed and interpreted. We discuss two alternative model parameterizations: one in which the effects of the el-el interaction are implicitly incorporated in the otherwise "noninteracting" TB parameters, and a second where we include an explicit mean-field el-el interaction term in the TB Hamiltonian. Both models yield a set of tabulated TB parameters which provide the band dispersion in excellent agreement with the underlying ab initio and MLWF bands.},

Rice Bell Telephone Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 (Received 31 January 1972) The addition of Ti3+ and Mg2+ to V 203 leads to the suppression of the antiferromagnetic insulating phase; whereas the addition of TiH, ZrH, and Fe3+ results in a first-order transition from a metallic to an insulating state. The effect of impurity ions is discussed in terms of the changes they cause in the bandwidth in analogy with the effect of pressure. The Hall coefficient of metallic V P3 at 4.2 oK and 20 kbar is RH = +(3.5$\pm$0.4)X 10-4 cm3/C which is close to the value measured at 150 oK and I atm. The residual resistivity of metallic V 203 is strongly impurity dependent (140 ILfi cm/at. {\%} Cr and 35 ILfi cm/at. {\%} Ti). These results are not completely consistent with current theories for the metal-insulator transition in V 203 but the best available model still seems to involve a localized-to-nonlocalized transition within the d band primarily involving orbitals in the basal plane.},

The calculated spectrum is in very good agreement with experiment.

	abstract = {? 2016 Nature Publishing GroupThe insulator?metal transition remains among the most studied phenomena in correlated electron physics. However, the spontaneous formation of spatial patterns amidst insulator?metal phase coexistence remains poorly explored on the meso- and nanoscales. Here we present real-space evolution of the insulator?metal transition in a V2O3 thin film imaged at high spatial resolution by cryogenic near-field infrared microscopy. We resolve spontaneously nanotextured coexistence of metal and correlated Mott insulator phases near the insulator?metal transition (?160?180 K) associated with percolation and an underlying structural phase transition. Augmented with macroscopic temperature-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements of the same film, a quantitative analysis of nano-infrared images acquired across the transition suggests decoupling of electronic and structural transformations. Persistent low-temperature metallicity is accompanied by unconventional critical behaviour, implicating the long-range Coulomb interaction as a driving force through the film?s first-order insulator?metal transition.},

	abstract = {Intriguing phenomena and novel physics predicted for two-dimensional (2D) systems formed by electrons in Dirac or Rashba states motivate an active search for new materials or combinations of the already revealed ones. Being very promising ingredients in themselves, interplaying Dirac and Rashba systems can provide a base for next generation of spintronics devices, to a considerable extent, by mixing their striking properties or by improving technically significant characteristics of each other. Here, we demonstrate that in BiTeI@PbSb2Te4 composed of a BiTeI trilayer on top of the topological insulator (TI) PbSb2Te4 weakly- and strongly-coupled Dirac-Rashba hybrid systems are realized. The coupling strength depends on both interface hexagonal stacking and trilayer-stacking order. The weakly-coupled system can serve as a prototype to examine, e.g., plasmonic excitations, frictional drag, spin-polarized transport, and charge-spin separation effect in multilayer helical metals. In the strongly-coupled regime, within {\~{}}100 meV energy interval of the bulk TI projected bandgap a helical state substituting for the TI surface state appears. This new state is characterized by a larger momentum, similar velocity, and strong localization within BiTeI. We anticipate that our findings pave the way for designing a new type of spintronics devices based on Rashba-Dirac coupled systems.},

Over the past 30 years, Rashba spin-orbit coupling has inspired a vast number of predictions, discoveries and innovative concepts far beyond semiconductors. The past decade has been particularly creative, with the realizations of manipulating spin orientation by moving electrons in space, controlling electron trajectories using spin as a steering wheel, and the discovery of new topological classes of materials. This progress has reinvigorated the interest of physicists and materials scientists in the development of inversion asymmetric structures, ranging from layered graphene-like materials to cold atoms.

@article{Graf2011NP,
	abstract = {High-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} cuprate superconductors are characterized by a strong momentum-dependent anisotropy between the low energy excitations along the Brillouin zone diagonal (nodal direction) and those along the Brillouin zone face (antinodal direction). Most obvious is the d-wave superconducting gap, with the largest magnitude found in the antinodal direction and no gap in the nodal direction. Additionally, while antinodal quasiparticle excitations appear only below {\$}T{\_}c{\$}, superconductivity is thought to be indifferent to nodal excitations as they are regarded robust and insensitive to {\$}T{\_}c{\$}. Here we reveal an unexpected tie between nodal quasiparticles and superconductivity using high resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission on optimally doped Bi{\$}{\_}2{\$}Sr{\$}{\_}2{\$}CaCu{\$}{\_}2{\$}O{\$}{\_}{\{}8+\backslashdelta{\}}{\$}. We observe a suppression of the nodal quasiparticle spectral weight following pump laser excitation and measure its recovery dynamics. This suppression is dramatically enhanced in the superconducting state. These results reduce the nodal-antinodal dichotomy and challenge the conventional view of nodal excitation neutrality in superconductivity.},

	abstract = {Strong optical pulses at mid-infrared and terahertz frequencies have recently emerged as a powerful tool to manipulate and control the solid state and especially complex condensed matter systems with strongly correlated electrons. The recent developments in high-power sources in the 0.1-30 THz frequency range, both from table-top laser systems and Free-Electron Lasers, has provided access to excitations of molecules and solids, which can be stimulated at their resonance frequencies. Amongst these, we discuss free electrons in metals, superconducting gaps and Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors, vibrational modes of the crystal lattice (phonons), as well as magnetic excitations. This Review provides an overview and illustrative examples of how intense THz transients can be used to resonantly control matter, with particular focus on strongly correlated electron systems and high-temperature superconductors.},

	abstract = {Nonlocal transport through edge channels holds great promise for low-power
	information processing. However, edge channels have so far only been
	demonstrated to occur in the quantum Hall regime, at high magnetic
	fields. We found that mercury telluride quantum wells in the quantum
	spin Hall regime exhibit nonlocal edge channel transport at zero
	external magnetic field. The data confirm that the quantum transport
	through the (helical) edge channels is dissipationless and that the
	contacts lead to equilibration between the counterpropagating spin
	states at the edge. The experimental data agree quantitatively with
	the theory of the quantum spin Hall effect. The edge channel transport
	paves the way for a new generation of spintronic devices for low-power
	information processing.},

	abstract = {Symmetry-broken three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetal systems with strong spin-orbit coupling can host many exotic Hall-like phenomena and Weyl fermion quantum transport. Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we performed systematic electronic structure studies on Cd3As2, which has been predicted to be the parent material, from which many unusual topological phases can be derived. We observe a highly linear bulk band crossing to form a 3D dispersive Dirac cone projected at the Brillouin zone centre by studying the (001)-cleaved surface. Remarkably, an unusually high in-plane Fermi velocity up to 1.5×10(6) ms(-1) is observed in our samples, where the mobility is known up to 40,000 cm2 V(-1) s(-1), suggesting that Cd3As2 can be a promising candidate as an anisotropic-hypercone (three-dimensional) high spin-orbit analogue of 3D graphene. Our discovery of the Dirac-like bulk topological semimetal phase in Cd3As2 opens the door for exploring higher dimensional spin-orbit Dirac physics in a real material.},

@article{Lv2015NP,
	abstract = {In 1929, H. Weyl proposed that the massless solution of Dirac equation represents a pair of new type particles, the so-called Weyl fermions [1]. However the existence of them in particle physics remains elusive for more than eight decades. Recently, significant advances in both topological insulators and topological semimetals have provided an alternative way to realize Weyl fermions in condensed matter as an emergent phenomenon: when two non-degenerate bands in the three-dimensional momentum space cross in the vicinity of Fermi energy (called as Weyl nodes), the low energy excitation behaves exactly the same as Weyl fermions. Here, by performing soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements which mainly probe bulk band structure, we directly observe the long-sought-after Weyl nodes for the first time in TaAs, whose projected locations on the (001) surface match well to the Fermi arcs, providing undisputable experimental evidence of existence of Weyl fermion quasiparticles in TaAs.},

As a consequence of the phase transition, the Raman spectrum also shows an abrupt change of both the phonon and electronic excitations. Most notable are (i) disappearance of the electronic continuum, which is very strong and broad in the metallic state, and (ii) altered coupling of a fully symmetric phonon to the electronic subsystem, which is shown to be temperature dependent even above the transition. We notice that although the spectra obtained by the time- and frequency-domain spectroscopies are similar, there are distinct differences in phonon line shape.},

The oxygen defect order can be highly inhomogeneous, even in optimal superconducting samples, which raises the question of the nature of the sample regions where the order does not exist but which nonetheless form the "glue" binding the ordered regions together. Here we use scanning X-ray microdiffraction (with a beam 300 nm in diameter) to show that for La(2)CuO(4+y), the glue regions contain incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions, whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples. For an underdoped single crystal with mobile oxygen interstitials in the spacer La(2)O(2+y) layers intercalated between the CuO(2) layers, the incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions form droplets anticorrelated with the ordered oxygen interstitials, and whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples. In this simplest of high temperature superconductors, there are therefore not one, but two networks of ordered defects which can be tuned to achieve optimal superconductivity. For a given stoichiometry, the highest transition temperature is obtained when both the ordered oxygen and lattice defects form fractal patterns, as opposed to appearing in isolated spots. We speculate that the relationship between material complexity and superconducting transition temperature T(c) is actually underpinned by a fundamental relation between T(c) and the distribution of ordered defect networks supported by the materials.},

Polarization-dependent measurements performed at low photon energy along high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone made it possible to get new insight into the role of the five Fe 3d orbitals in the complex electronic structure of this compound close to the Fermi level, in particular, into the nature of the holelike pockets. Two distinct inner ? pockets could be disentangled, suggesting that their origin is probably due to hybridized dxz and dyz. We also show that the complex outer ? pocket is mainly of dz2 nature, with contributions of other orbitals of different symmetry only in specific points of the Brillouin zone, in the proximity of the kz=1 [4?/c] plane. The identification of a dz2 nature for ? contributes to our understanding of the role of electron correlations in 122 pnictide superconductors and of the enhancement of the three-dimensional character of the Fermi surface in Co-doped compounds. ? 2011 American Physical Society.},

There remain fundamental questions regarding its nature and its relation to superconductivity. But to address these questions, we must first determine whether the pseudogap and superconducting states share a common property: particle-hole symmetry. We introduce a new technique to test particle-hole symmetry by using laser pulses to manipulate and measure the chemical potential on picosecond time scales. The results strongly suggest that the asymmetry in the density of states is inverted in the pseudogap state, implying a particle-hole asymmetric gap.

@article{Suga2015JESRP,
	abstract = {High resolution photoelectron spectroscopy is recognized to be a very powerful approach to study surface and bulk electronic structures of various solids by employing different photon energies (h$\nu$). In particular, angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) has progressed dramatically in the last few decades providing useful information on Fermi surface (FS) topology and band dispersions. The information of the electron spin is often decisive to fully understand the electronic properties of many material classes. However, spin-resolved studies by photoelectron spectroscopy were strongly hindered by the low detection efficiency of spin detectors. In the case of surface electronic structures, possible surface degradation with time is a serious problem to discuss intrinsic electronic effects. Therefore rather fast and high efficiency detection is required in the case of surface sensitive spin-resolved ARPES. Two-dimensional (2D) detection is nowadays widely employed in ARPES. In the use of a conventional hemispherical deflection analyzer (HDA), one direction on the 2D detector corresponds to the binding energy EBand the other direction to the emission angle. The novel concept of momentum microscopy, however, directly provides 2D (kx,ky) maps of the photoemission intensities. The reciprocal space image directly represents the cross section through the valence band structure of the sample at a selected energy. By scanning EB, very high resolution three-dimensional EB(kx,ky) maps of the band-dispersion can be obtained with high efficiency. If combined with a 2D imaging spin filter, based on electron reflection at a Au/Ir(0 0 1) surface, spin detection efficiency with orders of magnitude higher than other spin detectors is realized, opening a breakthrough in spin-resolved ARPES (SP-ARPES).},

@book{Zhang2013,
	abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

The obtained band structure and Fermi surface agree well with the band structure calculation of Na2Ti2Sb2O in the non-magnetic state, which indicates that there is no magnetic order in Na2Ti2Sb2O and the electronic correlation is weak. Polarization dependent ARPES results suggest the multi-band and multi-orbital nature of Na2Ti2Sb2O. Photon energy dependent ARPES results suggest that the electronic structure of Na2Ti2Sb2O is rather two-dimensional. Moreover, we find a density wave energy gap forms below the transition temperature and reaches 65 meV at 7 K, indicating that Na2Ti2Sb2O is likely a weakly correlated CDW material in the strong electron-phonon interaction regime.},

The photoelectron intensity maps are monitored as a function of temperature, photoexcitation density, and delay time from the pump pulse. We evince that thermal fluctuations are effective only for temperatures near the critical value whereas photoinduced fluctuations scale linearly at low pumping fluence. The minimal energy to fully disrupt the superconducting gap slightly increases when moving off the nodal direction. No evidence of a pseudogap arising from other phenomena than pairing has been detected in the explored region of reciprocal space. On the other hand, a model accounting for the finite pair breaking explains the gap filling both in the near-nodal as well as in the off-nodal direction. Finally, we observed that nodal quasiparticles develop a faster dynamics when pumping the superconductor with fluence large enough to induce the total collapse of the gap.},

	abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most direct methods of studying the electronic structure of solids. By measuring the kinetic energy and angular distribution of the electrons photoemitted from a sample illuminated with sufficiently high-energy radiation, one can gain information on both the energy and momentum of the electrons propagating inside a material. This is of vital importance in elucidating the connection between electronic, magnetic, and chemical structure of solids, in particular for those complex systems which cannot be appropriately described within the independent-particle picture. The last decade witnessed significant progress in this technique and its applications, thus ushering in a new era in photoelectron spectroscopy; today, ARPES experiments with 2 meV energy resolution and 0.28 angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. In this paper we will review the fundamentals of the technique and present some illustrative experimental results; we will show how ARPES can probe the momentum-dependent electronic structure of solids providing detailed information on band dispersion and Fermi surface as well as on the strength and nature of many-body correlations, which may profoundly affect the one-electron excitation spectrum and in turn the macroscopic physical properties.},

	abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra hold a wealth of information about the many-body interactions in a correlated material. However, the quantitative analysis of ARPES spectra to extract the various coupling parameters in a consistent manner is extremely challenging, even for a model Fermi liquid system. We propose a fitting procedure which allows quantitative access to the intrinsic line shape, deconvolved of energy and momentum resolution effects, of the correlated two-dimensional material Sr2RuO4. In correlated two-dimensional materials, we find an ARPES linewidth that is narrower than its binding energy, a key property of quasiparticles within Fermi liquid theory. We also find that when the electron-electron scattering component is separated from the electron-phonon and impurity scattering terms, it decreases with a functional form compatible with Fermi liquid theory as the Fermi energy is approached. In combination with the previously determined Fermi surface, these results give a complete picture of a Fermi liquid system via ARPES. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of the extracted imaginary part of the self-energy is in remarkable agreement with DC transport measurements.},

@article{Seah1979SIA,
	abstract = {A compilation is presented of all published measurements of electron inelastic mean free path lengths in solids for energies in the range 0--10 000 eV above the Fermi level. For analysis, the materials are grouped under one of the headings: element, inorganic compound, organic compound and adsorbed gas, with the path lengths each time expressed in nanometers, monolayers and milligrams per square metre. The path lengths are vary high at low energies, fall to 0.1--0.8 nm for energies in the range 30--100 eV and then rise again as the energy increases further. For elements and inorganic compounds the scatter about a `universal curve' is least when the path lengths are expressed in monolayers, $\lambda$m. Analysis of the inter-element and inter-compound effects shows that $\lambda$m is related to atom size and the most accuratae relations are $\lambda$m = 538E−2+0.41(aE)1/2 for elements and $\lambda$m=2170E−2+0.72(aE)1/2 for inorganic compounds, where a is the monolayer thickness (nm) and E is the electron energy above the Fermi level in eV. For organic compounds $\lambda$d=49E−2+0.11E1/2 mgm−2. Published general theoretical predictions for $\lambda$, valid above 150 eV, do not show as good correlations with the experimental data as the above relations.},

The appearance of trivial mass terms is expected to cause quantum phase transitions into trivial phases when such a perturbation overweighs the topological term. These phase transitions are usually associated with a bulk-gap closing. In contrast, the chiral Chern insulator is unaffected by particle-number breaking perturbations. Moreover, the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/28/40/405502/cmaa34a1ieqn001.gif] {${{\mathbb{Z}}_{2}}$} topological insulator undergoes phase transitions into topologically trivial phases without bulk-gap closing in the presence of any of such perturbations. In certain cases, these phase transitions can be circumvented and the protection restored by another U(1) symmetry, e.g. due to spin conservation. These findings are discussed in the context of interacting topological insulators.},

We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d < 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d > 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field--induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.},

	abstract = {The effectively massless, relativistic behaviour of graphene's charge carriers---known as Dirac fermions---is a result of its unique electronic structure, characterized by conical valence and conduction bands that meet at a single point in momentum space (at the Dirac crossing energy). The study of many-body interactions amongst the charge carriers in graphene and related systems such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and graphite is of interest owing to their contribution to superconductivity and other exotic ground states in these systems. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that electron--plasmon coupling plays an unusually strong role in renormalizing the bands around the Dirac crossing energy---analogous to mass renormalization by electron--boson coupling in ordinary metals. Our results show that electron--electron, electron--plasmon and electron--phonon coupling must be considered on an equal footing in attempts to understand the dynamics of quasiparticles in graphene and related systems.},

The electrons dynamics show that inelastic scattering by nodal quasiparticles decreases when the temperature is lowered below the critical value of the superconducting phase transition. This drop of electronic dissipation is astonishingly robust and survives to photoexcitation densities much larger than the value sustained by long-range superconductivity. The unconventional behaviour of quasiparticle scattering is ascribed to superconducting correlations extending on a length scale comparable to the inelastic path. Our measurements indicate that strongly driven superconductors enter in a regime without phase coherence but finite pairing amplitude. The latter vanishes near to the critical temperature and has no evident link with the pseudogap observed by Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARPES).},

We explored the role of interactions with the external environment on this vibrational mode by comparing the response observed for graphene layers supported by different substrates and suspended in free space. No significant frequency shifts were observed.},

Crystals were grown from the melt by slow cooling from 1050 to 950$\,^{\circ}$C. The sulfur atoms in the Co-S layers have very anisotropic thermal displacement parameters, possibly indicating that these sulfurs are actually in a double well potential centered at a high symmetry position in the space group Cmma . BaCoS2is found to be a paramagnetic semiconductor (Mott insulator). The magnetic properties indicate that BaCoS2undergoes a transformation at 300 K, which is likely due to the onset of antiferromagnetic order. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Until recently, spin-polarization in nonmagnetic materials was the exclusive territory of low-symmetry crystals, in particular those that lack global inversion symmetry. It was recently shown that a form of hidden spin polarization (named R-2 effect) could exist in centrosymmetric crystals in which individual layers are inversion asymmetric. But other than the abstract notion that such R-2 materials should have layers that belong to polar point group symmetries, there was no practical principle to guide their identification. Here we (i) formulate design principles that indicate ideal R-2 effect; (ii) classify different prototype layered structures that have been broadly studied in the literature for their other functionalities in terms of their expected R-2 behavior, including the Bi2Se3-structure type (a topological insulator), MoS2-structure type (a valleytronic compound) and LaBiOS2-structure type (a superconductor host); (iii) use first-principles band theory to evaluate the specific R-2 design metrics in 17 members of the most promising prototype family of LaOBiS2-type P4/nmm structures. We find large spin splittings (up to 196 meV for holes in LaOBiTe2) as well as characteristic spin textures and surface states. Experimental testing of this prediction is called in terms of their expected R-2 behavior for, and could considerably broaden the range of spintronic crystals.},

	abstract = {Attention is drawn to a class of semi-conductors or insulators with in-completely filled 3d bands. Their lack of conductivity, if the number of electrons per atom is an integer, is explained by the circumstance that a moving electron will have a large probability of being withdrawn to the initial atom, if only the potential barriers to be penetrated are sufficiently high to reduce the frequency of transition below a certain limit. This inhibiting factor disappears, if for ions of equal electronic levels the number of electrons per atom differs from an integer. In the case of NiO this condition is fulfilled if an electron is brought by thermal excitation from the lattice 3d band into the.somewhat raised and less occupied levels a, a' (figure I); these levels belong to Ni ions adjacent to a vacant Ni lattice point introduced by the deviations from stoichiometry, and two of these Ni ions are at the absolute zero Ni3+ ions. An analogous conduction mechanism holds for non-stoichiometric Cu,O, with a completely filled 3d band (figure 2) . Photoconductivity is generally observed with substances with completely filled zones and never with substances of the NiO type. A tentative explanation is given for this fact on the basis of the model of figure I and figure 2. In non-stoechiometric ZnO vacant oxygen lattice points are assumed (figure 3) ; in that case the calculation of the lattice levels shows that at the lattice holes one Zn2+ is converted into Zn, whereas in the lattice the additional electrons form Zn+ ions, as will be the case after thermal transitions of the electrons belonging to these Zn atoms into the lattice qs band. {\$} 1 .

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we unravel the unique surface Fermi arcs, in good agreement with our ab-initio calculations. From spin-resolved ARPES measurements, we demonstrate the non-degenerate spin-texture of surface Fermi-arcs, thereby proving their non-trivial topological nature. Our work not only lead to new understandings of the unusual properties discovered in this family of compounds, but also allow for the further exploration of exotic properties and practical applications of type-II TWSs, as well as the interplay between superconductivity (MoTe2 was discovered to be superconducting recently) and their topological order.},

@article{Gierz2013NM,
	abstract = {The optical properties of graphene are made unique by the linear band structure and the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. It has been proposed that even in the absence of a semiconducting bandgap, a relaxation bottleneck at the Dirac point may allow for population inversion and lasing at arbitrarily long wavelengths. Furthermore, efficient carrier multiplication by impact ionization has been discussed in the context of light harvesting applications. However, all these effects are difficult to test quantitatively by measuring the transient optical properties alone, as these only indirectly reflect the energy and momentum dependent carrier distributions. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with femtosecond extreme ultra-violet (EUV) pulses at 31.5 eV photon energy to directly probe the non-equilibrium response of Dirac electrons near the K-point of the Brillouin zone. In lightly hole-doped epitaxial graphene samples, we explore excitation in the mid- and near-infrared, both below and above the minimum photon energy for direct interband transitions. While excitation in the mid-infrared results only in heating of the equilibrium carrier distribution, interband excitations give rise to population inversion, suggesting that terahertz lasing may be possible. However, in neither excitation regime do we find indication for carrier multiplication, questioning the applicability of graphene for light harvesting. Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the EUV emerges as the technique of choice to assess the suitability of new materials for optoelectronics, providing quantitatively accurate measurements of non-equilibrium carriers at all energies and wavevectors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present experimental results on the effect of space charging in photoelectron spectroscopy from a surface using a pulsed and intense femtosecond light source. We particularly focus on a quantitative evaluation of the induced spectral broadening. Our results are compared with analytic calculations based on energy conservation considerations as well as with experimental results from measurements using picosecond pulses for the excitation process. As a measure of space charge effects, we monitored the angular and energy distributions of the photoemission from the occupied Shockley surface state of Cu(111) as a function of the total number N of the photoemitted electrons per laser pulse. Our results show that spectral distortions exist for the entire laser fluence regime probed. The energetic broadening of the surface state peak can be fitted with remarkable accuracy by a N dependence, in agreement with the theoretical predictions and different from the experimental picosecond results, where a dominating linear dependence has been reported. In addition to a pure energetic broadening of the photoemissionspectra, we also identify modifications in the angular distribution of the photoemitted electrons due to space charge effects.},

@article{Barbo2000RSI,
	abstract = {In the course of 1998, the Spectromicroscopy beamline at ELETTRA completed commissioning and succeeded in performing its first test experiments. The beamline is designed to perform photoemissionexperiments with high spatial resolution, which is obtained by focusing the radiation in a small spot on the sample by means of a multilayer-coated Schwarzschild Objective. Three objectives are currently available; these operate at photon energies of 74, 95, and 110 eV. A review is presented of the performances achieved together with an outlook on the future upgrades of the microscope. The smallest achievable spot size is currently 0.5 $\mu$m. At present, the limit to the spatial resolution is due to aberrations caused by figure errors of the objective. Typical counting rates in photoemissionspectra, for example, on the Au  5d peak, are of the order of 10 4 --10 5 counts per second with an energy resolution of the order of 100--200 meV. Among the first experiments in which p- and n-type GaAs layers of 0.25 $\mu$m thickness were imaged.},

	abstract = {In a type I Dirac or Weyl semimetal, the low energy states are squeezed to a single point in momentum space when the chemical potential Ef is tuned precisely to the Dirac/Weyl point. Recently, a type II Weyl semimetal was predicted to exist, where the Weyl states connect hole and electron bands, separated by an indirect gap. This leads to unusual energy states, where hole and electron pockets touch at the Weyl point. Here we present the discovery of a type II topological Weyl semimetal (TWS) state in pure MoTe2, where two sets of WPs (W2+-, W3+-) exist at the touching points of electron and hole pockets and are located at different binding energies above Ef. Using ARPES, modeling, DFT and calculations of Berry curvature, we identify the Weyl points and demonstrate that they are connected by different sets of Fermi arcs for each of the two surface terminations. We also find new surface "track states" that form closed loops and are unique to type II Weyl semimetals. This material provides an exciting, new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions.},

Measurements of the band structure of a Au(111) single crystal surface demonstrate an energy resolution of $\delta$E=12meV and a momentum resolution of $\delta$k=0.0049A-1, measured at the line-width of the spin-orbit split Shockley surface state. The relative accuracy of the kmeasurement in the order of 10-4A-1 reveals a deviation from the ideal two-dimensional free electron gas model of the Shockley surface state, manifested in a threefold radial symmetry. Spin resolution in the full momentum image is obtained by an imaging spin-filter based on low-energy electron diffraction at a Au passivated Ir(100) single crystal. Using working points at 10.5eV and 11.5eV scattering energy with a completely reversed asymmetry of $\pm$60{\%} we demonstrate the efficient mapping of the spin texture of the Au(111) surface state.},

The interplay between such phases is thought to play a critical role in the unconventional superconductivity of cuprates, Fe-based, and heavy-fermion systems, yet even for the more moderately-correlated TMDCs, their nature and origins have proved highly controversial. Here, we study a prototypical example, {\$}2H{\$}-NbSe{\$}{\_}2{\$}, by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission and first-principles theory. We find that the normal state, from which its hallmark collective phases emerge, is characterised by quasiparticles whose spin is locked to their valley pseudospin. This results from a combination of strong spin-orbit interactions and local inversion symmetry breaking. Non-negligible interlayer coupling further drives a rich three-dimensional momentum-dependence of the underlying Fermi surface spin texture. Together, these findings necessitate a fundamental re-investigation of the nature of charge order and superconducting pairing in NbSe{\$}{\_}2{\$} and related TMDCs.},

@article{Rotter2008PRL,
	abstract = {The ternary iron arsenide BaFe2As2 becomes superconducting by hole doping, which was achieved by partial substitution of the barium site with potassium. We have discovered bulk superconductivity up to Tc = 38 K in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2 with x = 0.4. The parent compound BaFe2As2 as well as KFe2As2 both crystallize in the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure, which consists of (FeAs)- iron arsenide layers separated by barium or potassium ions. BaFe2As2 is a poor metal and exhibits a SDW anomaly at 140 K. By substituting Ba2+ for K+ ions we have introduced holes in the (FeAs)- layers, which suppress the SDW anomaly and induce superconductivity. This scenario is very similar to the recently discovered arsenide-oxide superconductors. The Tc of 38 K in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2 is the highest observed critical temperature in hole doped iron arsenide superconductors so far. Therefore, we were able to expand this class of superconductors by oxygen-free compounds with the ThCr2Si2-type structure. Our results suggest, that superconductivity in these systems essentially evolves from the (FeAs)- layers and may occur in other related compounds.},

Due to their high localization, core electrons are extremely sensitive to the chemical state and to the local environment, and for this reason can be used for the identification of local configurations. The high energy resolution now attainable with this technique (below 100meV) and the reduced data acquisition time (down to few ms per spectrum) has opened the possibility to probe the physical and chemical properties of a large variety of low-dimensional systems and to shed light on complex processes taking place on solid surfaces. The characterization of the properties of mono- and bi-metallic materials, the investigation of the atomic and molecular interactions on solid surfaces and the recent findings on epitaxial graphene outline the potential of high energy resolution core level photoelectron spectroscopy and photoelectron diffraction as precious tools in determining nanoscale electronic, geometrical and chemical properties.},

We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission study of the nodal quasiparticle spectra of the high-Tc cuprate trilayer Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+$\delta$ (Tc∼110 K). The spectral weight Z of the nodal quasiparticle increases with decreasing temperature across Tc. Such a temperature dependence is qualitatively similar to that of the coherence peak intensity in the antinodal region of various high-Tc cuprates, although the nodal spectral weight remains finite and large above Tc. We attribute this observation to the reduction of electron correlation strength in going from the normal metallic state to the superconducting state, a characteristic behavior of a superconductor with strong electron correlation.},

However,the theory of the insulating state remained somewhat incomplete until the late 1990s; this review addresses the recentdevelopments. The many-body ground wavefunction of any insulator is characterized by means ofgeometrical concepts (Berry phase, connection, curvature, Chern number, quantum metric). Amongthem, it is the quantum metric which sharply characterizes the insulating state of matter. Thetheory deals on a common ground with several kinds of insulators: band insulators, Mott insulators,Anderson insulators, quantum Hall insulators, Chern and topological insulators.},

For a two-dimensional crystal, the distribution function has logarithmically infinite peaks.

	abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (x-ray FELs) give us for the first time the possibility to explore structures and dynamical processes of atomic and molecular systems at the angstrom-femtosecond space and time scales. They generate coherent photon pulses with time duration of a few to 100 fs, peak power of 10 to 100 GW, over a wavelength range extending from about 100 nm to less than 1 {\AA}. Using these novel and unique capabilities new scientific results are being obtained in atomic and molecular sciences, in areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. This paper reviews the physical principles, the theoretical models, and the numerical codes on which x-ray FELs are based, starting from a single electron spontaneous undulator radiation to the FEL collective instability of a high density electron beam, strongly enhancing the electromagnetic radiation field intensity and its coherence properties. A short review is presented of the main experimental properties of x-ray FELs, and the results are discussed of the most recent research to improve their longitudinal coherence properties, increase the peak power, and generate multicolor spectra.},

@article{Meyer2007N,
	abstract = {The recent discovery of graphene has sparked much interest, thus far focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particles 1--3 . However, the physical structure of graphene---a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice---is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears to be a strictly two-dimensional material, exhibiting such a high crystal quality that electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scatter-ing. On the other hand, perfect two-dimensional crystals cannot exist in the free state, according to both theory and experiment 4--9 . This incompatibility can be avoided by arguing that all the gra-phene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger three-dimensional structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a three-dimensional matrix 1--3,9--12 . Here we report on individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabri-cated scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick, yet they still display long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission electron microscopy also reveal that these suspended graphene sheets are not perfectly flat: they exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1 nm. The atomically thin single-crystal mem-branes offer ample scope for fundamental research and new tech-nologies, whereas the observed corrugations in the third dimension may provide subtle reasons for the stability of two-dimensional crystals 13--15 . Whether a strictly two-dimensional (2D) crystal can exist was first raised theoretically more than 70 years ago by Peierls 4,5 and Landau 6,7 . They showed that, in the standard harmonic approximation 16 , ther-mal fluctuations should destroy long-range order, resulting in melt-ing of a 2D lattice at any finite temperature. Furthermore, Mermin and Wagner proved that a magnetic long-range order could not exist in one and two dimensions 17 and later extended the proof to crystal-line order in 2D 8 . Importantly, numerous experiments on thin films have been in accord with the theory, showing that below a certain thickness, typically of dozens of atomic layers, the films become thermodynamically unstable (segregate into islands or decompose) unless they constitute an inherent part of a three-dimensional (3D) system (such as being grown on top of a bulk crystal with a matching lattice) 18--20 . However, although the theory does not allow perfect crystals in 2D space, it does not forbid nearly perfect 2D crystals in 3D space. Indeed, a detailed analysis of the 2D crystal problem beyond the harmonic approximation has led to the conclusion 13--15 that the interaction between bending and stretching long-wavelength phonons could in principle stabilize atomically thin membranes through their deformation in the third dimension 15 . Indeed, the experiments described here show that freely suspended graphene crystals can exist without a substrate, and exhibit random elastic deformations involving all three dimensions. The preparation of graphene membranes used in this study is described in the text of the Supplementary Information and in Supplementary Fig. 1. Briefly, we used the established procedures},

However, the fact that the Dirac bands in graphene are made up of sp(2) electrons, which are subject to neither strong Hubbard repulsion U nor strong Hund's rule coupling J, creates certain limitations in terms of novel, interaction-induced physics that could be derived from Dirac points. Here we propose GaCu3(OH)6Cl2 (Ga-substituted herbertsmithite) as a correlated Dirac-Kagome metal combining Dirac electrons, strong interactions and frustrated magnetic interactions. Using density functional theory, we calculate its crystallographic and electronic properties, and observe that it has symmetry-protected Dirac points at the Fermi level. Its many-body physics is diverse, with possible charge, magnetic and superconducting instabilities. Through a combination of various many-body methods we study possible symmetry-lowering phase transitions such as Mott-Hubbard, charge or magnetic ordering, and unconventional superconductivity, which in this compound assumes an f-wave symmetry.},

	abstract = {A theory of photoemission is presented in which all results are derived rigorously from first principles. It is shown how to calculate properly the external current of electrons, with the transmission at the surface done correctly. A new and rigorous formalism is derived for doing many-body calculations in photoemission. Extensive calculations are performed on the angular dependence of photoemission. It is shown that the angular anisotropy is interesting and significant. Numerous numerical examples are presented for the alkali metals.},

We consider both a simple superlattice model and a more realistic tight-binding model describing an experimentally reasonable HgTe/CdTe multilayer structure. The two models have the same underlying symmetry, therefore their low-energy features are equivalent. We find a Weyl semimetal phase between the normal insulator and the topological insulator phases that exists for a finite range of the system parameters and exhibits a finite number of Weyl points with robust band touching at the Fermi level. This phase is experimentally characterized by a strong conductivity anisotropy and topological surface states. The principal conductivities change in a complementary fashion as the system parameters are varied, and the surface states only exist in a region of momentum space that is determined by the positions of the Weyl points.},

@article{Ryu2010NJOP,
	abstract = {It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a  or a  topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via `dimensional reduction'by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in `Kaluza--Klein'-like fashion). For -topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The -topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent -topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle--hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern--Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d=1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).},

This allows us to define the parameter range (Hubbard U versus spin--orbit coupling) where the 2D system behaves as a trivial insulator or quantum spin Hall insulator. This behavior is confirmed by the existence of gapless quasi-particle states in honeycomb ribbons. We have discussed the importance of the cluster symmetry and the effects of the lack of full translation symmetry typical of CPT and of most quantum cluster approaches. Comments on the limits of applicability of the method are also provided.},

While the degeneracy points in Weyl semimetals are robust against any perturbation that preserves translational symmetry, nodal lines require protection by additional crystalline symmetries such as mirror reflection. Here we report, based on a systematic theoretical study and a detailed experimental characterization, the existence of topological nodal-line states in the non-centrosymmetric compound PbTaSe2 with strong spin-orbit coupling. Remarkably, the spin-orbit nodal lines in PbTaSe2 are not only protected by the reflection symmetry but also characterized by an integer topological invariant. Our detailed angle-resolved photoemission measurements, first-principles simulations and theoretical topological analysis illustrate the physical mechanism underlying the formation of the topological nodal-line states and associated surface states for the first time, thus paving the way towards exploring the exotic properties of the topological nodal-line fermions in condensed matter systems.},

	abstract = {The past decade's apparent success in predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of topological insulators (TIs) and semimetals masks a fundamental shortcoming: out of 200,000 stoichiometric compounds extant in material databases, only several hundred of them are topologically nontrivial. Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem with the current piecemeal approach to finding them? To address this, we propose a new and complete electronic band theory that highlights the link between topology and local chemical bonding, and combines this with the conventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the universal global properties of all possible band structures and materials, comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group theoretical description in real space. We classify the possible band structures for all 230 crystal symmetry groups that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically nontrivial. We show how our topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs, and demonstrate the power of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.},

We used a femtosecond laser pump pulse to perturb superconducting Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+$\delta$) and studied subsequent dynamics using time- and angle-resolved photoemission and infrared reflectivity probes. Gap and quasiparticle population dynamics revealed marked dependencies on both excitation density and crystal momentum. Close to the d-wave nodes, the superconducting gap was sensitive to the pump intensity, and Cooper pairs recombined slowly. Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates.},

	abstract = {Photoinduced phase transitions are of special interest in condensed matter physics because they can be used to change complex macroscopic material properties on the ultrafast timescale. Cooperative interactions between microscopic degrees of freedom greatly enhance the number and nature of accessible states, making it possible to switch electronic, magnetic or structural properties in new ways. Photons with high energies, of the order of electron volts, in particular are able to access electronic states that may differ greatly from states produced with stimuli close to equilibrium. In this study we report the photoinduced change in the lattice structure of a charge and orbitally ordered Nd(0.5)Sr(0.5)MnO(3) thin film using picosecond time-resolved X-ray diffraction. The photoinduced state is structurally ordered, homogeneous, metastable and has crystallographic parameters different from any thermodynamically accessible state. A femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopic study shows the formation of an electronic gap in this state. In addition, the threshold-like behaviour and high efficiency in photo-generation yield of this gapped state highlight the important role of cooperative interactions in the formation process. These combined observations point towards a 'hidden insulating phase' distinct from that found in the hitherto known phase diagram.},

Parallel energy and momentum detection is carried out in a hemispherical electron analyzer coupled with an imaging detector.

Here we show that the interplay of surface and bulk transient carrier dynamics in a photoexcited topological insulator can control an essential parameter for photoconductivity-the balance between excess electrons and holes in the Dirac cone. This can result in a strongly out of equilibrium gas of hot relativistic fermions, characterized by a surprisingly long lifetime of more than 50 ps, and a simultaneous transient shift of chemical potential by as much as 100 meV.

	abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

	abstract = {Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are renowned for their rich and varied properties. They range from metals and superconductors to strongly spin-orbit-coupled semiconductors and charge-density-wave systems, with their single-layer variants one of the most prominent current examples of two-dimensional materials beyond graphene. Their varied ground states largely depend on the transition metal d-electron-derived electronic states, on which the vast majority of attention has been concentrated to date. Here, we focus on the chalcogen-derived states. From density-functional theory calculations together with spin- and angle- resolved photoemission, we find that these generically host type-II three-dimensional bulk Dirac fermions as well as ladders of topological surface states and surface resonances. We demonstrate how these naturally arise within a single p-orbital manifold as a general consequence of a trigonal crystal field, and as such can be expected across a large number of compounds. Already, we demonstrate their existence in six separate TMDs, opening routes to tune, and ultimately exploit, their topological physics.},

	abstract = {Bilayer graphene is a highly promising material for electronic and optoelectronic applications since it is supporting massive Dirac fermions with a tuneable band gap. However, no consistent picture of the gap's effect on the optical and transport behavior has emerged so far, and it has been proposed that the insulating nature of the gap could be compromised by unavoidable structural defects, by topological in-gap states, or that the electronic structure could be altogether changed by many-body effects. Here we directly follow the excited carriers in bilayer graphene on a femtosecond time scale, using ultrafast time- and angle-resolved photoemission. We find a behavior consistent with a single-particle band gap. Compared to monolayer graphene, the existence of this band gap leads to an increased carrier lifetime in the minimum of the lowest conduction band. This is in sharp contrast to the second sub-state of the conduction band, in which the excited electrons decay through fast, phonon-assisted inter-band transitions.},

@article{Lantz2017NC,
	abstract = {The study of photoexcited strongly correlated materials is attracting growing interest since their rich phase diagram often translates into an equally rich out-of-equilibrium behavior, including non-thermal phases and photoinduced phase transitions. With femtosecond optical pulses, electronic and lattice degrees of freedom can be transiently decoupled, giving the opportunity of stabilizing new states of matter inaccessible by quasi-adiabatic pathways. Here we present a study of the ultrafast non-equilibrium evolution of the prototype Mott-Hubbard material V2O3, which presents a transient non-thermal phase developing immediately after photoexcitation and lasting few picoseconds. For both the insulating and the metallic phase, the formation of the transient configuration is triggered by the excitation of electrons into the bonding a1g orbital, and is then stabilized by a lattice distortion characterized by a marked hardening of the A1g coherent phonon. This configuration is in stark contrast with the thermally accessible ones - the A1g phonon frequency actually softens when heating the material. Our results show the importance of selective electron-lattice interplay for the ultrafast control of material parameters, and are of particular relevance for the optical manipulation of strongly correlated systems, whose electronic and structural properties are often strongly intertwinned.},

The dispersion of electronic states is in qualitative agreement with band structure calculated for the VS2 slab without the incommensurate distortion. Nonetheless, the spectra display a temperature dependent pseudogap instead of quasiparticles crossing. The sudden photoexcitation at 50 K induces a partial filling of the electronic pseudogap within less than 80 fs. The electronic energy flows into the lattice modes on a comparable timescale. We attribute this surprisingly short timescale to a very strong electron-phonon coupling to the incommensurate distortion.

The photoinduced I-CDW phase then develops through a nucleation and growth process which ends 100 ps after laser excitation. We demonstrate that the newly formed I-CDW phase is fragmented into several nanometric domains that are growing through a coarsening process.

This technique can provide new understanding of the ground state properties of many interesting classes of quantum materials and offers a new tool to induce transient emergent properties with no counterpart at equilibrium.

	abstract = {Using time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we have investigated the nonequilibrium electronic structures of a VO2 thin film upon photoexcitation. We employed the high-harmonic generation method, which was crucial in obtaining the results. Irradiation by a 170-fs optical pulse at a fluence above ∼6 mJ/cm2 rapidly converts the insulating VO2 thin film into a metallic state, and we show that the transition is accompanied by a spectral-weight redistribution over a 1-eV scale. This observation provides direct spectroscopic evidence of an ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition. The transient metallic state has a unique spectrum that deviates from the static spectrum of the rutile metal phase. We also observe an anomalous spreading of spectral weight up to ∼0.4 eV above the Fermi level as soon as the transient metallic state emerges. The temporal evolution of the spectral weight near the Fermi level exhibits an ultrafast increase and a subsequent slower increase over ∼3 ps. We suggest that a broadening mechanism related to the excitation of phonon modes is responsible for the spreading of the spectral weight and that the slower increase of the spectral weight is associated with the expansion of the metallic region after photoinduced nucleation.

	abstract = {The transient response of Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2, x=0.08 was studied by pump-probe optical reflectivity. After ultrafast photoexcitation, hot electrons were found to relax with two different characteristic times, indicating the presence of two distinct decay channels: a faster one, of less than 1 ps in the considered pump fluence range and a slower one, corresponding to lattice thermalization and lasting ≅6 ps. Our analysis indicates that the fast relaxation should be attributed to preferential scattering of the electrons with only a subset of the lattice-vibration modes with a second moment of the Eliashberg function $\lambda$⟨$\omega$2⟩≅64 meV2. The simultaneous excitation of a strong fully symmetric A1g optical phonon corroborates this conclusion and makes it possible to deduce the value of $\lambda$≅0.12. This small value for the electron-phonon coupling confirms that a phonon-mediated process cannot be the only mechanism leading to the formation of superconducting pairs in this family of pnictides.},

	abstract = {For the investigation of processes happening on the time scale of the motion of bound electrons, well-controlled X-ray pulses with durations in the few-femtosecond and even sub-femtosecond range are a necessary prerequisite. Novel free-electron lasers sources provide these ultrashort, high-brightness X-ray pulses, but their unique aspects open up concomitant challenges for their characterization on a suitable time scale. In this review paper we describe progress and results of recent work on ultrafast pulse characterization at soft and hard X-ray free-electron lasers. We report on different approaches to laser-assisted time-domain measurements, with specific focus on single-shot characterization of ultrashort X-ray pulses from self-amplified spontaneous emission-based and seeded free-electron lasers. The method relying on the sideband measurement of X-ray electron ionization in the presence of a dressing optical laser field is described first. When the X-ray pulse duration is shorter than half the oscillation period of the streaking field, few-femtosecond characterization becomes feasible via linear streaking spectroscopy. Finally, using terahertz fields alleviates the issue of arrival time jitter between streaking laser and X-ray pulse, but compromises the achievable temporal resolution. Possible solutions to these remaining challenges for single-shot, full time--energy characterization of X-ray free-electron laser pulses are proposed in the outlook at the end of the review.},

	abstract = {High-harmonic generation is a universal response of matter to strong femtosecond laser fields, coherently upconverting light to much shorter wavelengths. Optimizing the conversion of laser light into soft x-rays typically demands a trade-off between two competing factors. Because of reduced quantum diffusion of the radiating electron wave function, the emission from each species is highest when a short-wavelength ultraviolet driving laser is used. However, phase matching--the constructive addition of x-ray waves from a large number of atoms--favors longer-wavelength mid-infrared lasers. We identified a regime of high-harmonic generation driven by 40-cycle ultraviolet lasers in waveguides that can generate bright beams in the soft x-ray region of the spectrum, up to photon energies of 280 electron volts. Surprisingly, the high ultraviolet refractive indices of both neutral atoms and ions enabled effective phase matching, even in a multiply ionized plasma. We observed harmonics with very narrow linewidths, while calculations show that the x-rays emerge as nearly time-bandwidth-limited pulse trains of {\~{}}100 attoseconds.},

Especially when the photon pulses are intense, Coulombic repulsion between the emitted electrons will be a limiting factor for photoemission experiments aiming at highest energy and angle resolutions. In the present work, the propagation of the photoelectron cloud to the detector is studied with a full N-body numerical simulation. The influence of various parameters, in particular number of electrons per pulse, source size, pulse duration, kinetic-energy and emission-angle distributions as well as presence of mirror charges in the sample, is investigated in detail. Previous experimental results obtained with various picosecond and femtosecond light sources are successfully reproduced and the general resolution limits of solid-state photoemission using pulsed photon sources are explored. The results are potentially important for the design and interpretation of photoemission experiments with next-generation light sources, such as free-electron lasers and high-harmonic generation sources.},

The system was designed to be integrated with a dedicated Scienta-Omicron DA30 electron energy analyzer allowing for two simultaneous reflectometry measurements, along perpendicular axes, that, after magnetization switching of the two targets, allow the three-dimensional vectorial reconstruction of the spin polarization to be performed while operating the DA30 in high-resolution mode. VESPA represents the very first installation for spin-resolved ARPES (SPARPES) at the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, and is being heavily exploited by SPARPES users since autumn 2015.},

We show that the phase diagram of this system contains a Weyl semimetal phase of the simplest possible kind, with only two Dirac nodes of opposite chirality, separated in momentum space, in its bandstructure. This particular type of Weyl semimetal has a finite anomalous Hall conductivity, chiral edge states, and occurs as an intermediate phase between an ordinary insulator and a 3D quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a quantized Hall conductivity, equal to {\$}e{\^{}}2/h{\$} per TI layer. We find that the Weyl semimetal has a nonzero DC conductivity at zero temperature and is thus an unusual metallic phase, characterized by a finite anomalous Hall conductivity and topologically-protected edge states.},

This holographic quantum phase transition is always of first order, signified by a discontinuous anomalous Hall conductivity at the phase transition, in contrast to the very continuous holographic Weyl semimetal/trivial semimetal phase transition.

@article{Lai2018POTNAOS,
	abstract = {While electronic states with nontrivial topology have traditionally been known in insulators, they have been evidenced in metals during the past 2 years. Such Weyl semimetals show topological protection while conducting electricity both in the bulk and on the surface. An outstanding question is whether topological protection can happen in metals with strong correlations. Here, we report theoretical work on a strongly correlated lattice model to demonstrate the emergence of a Weyl{\textendash}Kondo semimetal. We identify Weyl fermions in the bulk and Fermi arcs on the surface, both of which are associated with the many-body phenomenon called the Kondo effect. We determine a key signature of this Weyl{\textendash}Kondo semimetal, which is realized in a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound.Insulating states can be topologically nontrivial, a well-established notion that is exemplified by the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators. By contrast, topological metals have not been experimentally evidenced until recently. In systems with strong correlations, they have yet to be identified. Heavy-fermion semimetals are a prototype of strongly correlated systems and, given their strong spin-orbit coupling, present a natural setting to make progress. Here, we advance a Weyl{\textendash}Kondo semimetal phase in a periodic Anderson model on a noncentrosymmetric lattice. The quasiparticles near the Weyl nodes develop out of the Kondo effect, as do the surface states that feature Fermi arcs. We determine the key signatures of this phase, which are realized in the heavy-fermion semimetal Ce3Bi4Pd3. Our findings provide the much-needed theoretical foundation for the experimental search of topological metals with strong correlations and open up an avenue for systematic studies of such quantum phases that naturally entangle multiple degrees of freedom.},

In this context, photo-excitation is treated as an impulsive injection of electronic energy that is transferred to other degrees of freedom only at later times. Here, by studying the ultrafast dynamics of quasi-particles in an archetypal strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator (La2CuO(4+$\delta$)), we show that the interaction between electrons and bosons manifests itself directly in the photo-excitation processes of a correlated material. With the aid of a general theoretical framework (Hubbard-Holstein Hamiltonian), we reveal that sub-gap excitation pilots the formation of itinerant quasi-particles, which are suddenly dressed by an ultrafast reaction of the bosonic field.},

Their existence could explain the missing dark matter of the Universe. However, despite intensive searches, axions have yet to be observed. Here we show that magnetic fluctuations of topological insulators couple to the electromagnetic fields exactly like the axions, and propose several experiments to detect this dynamical axion field. In particular, we show that the axion coupling enables a nonlinear modulation of the electromagnetic field, leading to attenuated total reflection. We propose a new optical-modulator device based on this principle.},

Here we investigate the quantum transport of both bulk crystal and exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes in a field-effect transistor geometry. For the six septuple-layer device tuned into the insulating regime, we observe a large longitudinal resistance and zero Hall plateau, which are characteristics of an axion insulator state. The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck's constant and e is electron charge. Our results pave the way for using even-number septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 to realize the quantized topological magnetoelectric effect and axion electrodynamics in condensed matter systems.},

	abstract = {An axion insulator is a correlated topological phase, which is predicted to arise from the formation of a charge-density wave in a Weyl semimetal1,2---that is, a material in which electrons behave as massless chiral fermions. The accompanying sliding mode in the charge-density-wave phase---the phason---is an axion3,4 and is expected to cause anomalous magnetoelectric transport effects. However, this axionic charge-density wave has not yet been experimentally detected. Here we report the observation of a large positive contribution to the magnetoconductance in the sliding mode of the charge-density-wave Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I for collinear electric and magnetic fields. The positive contribution to the magnetoconductance originates from the anomalous axionic contribution of the chiral anomaly to the phason current, and is locked to the parallel alignment of the electric and magnetic fields. By rotating the magnetic field, we show that the angular dependence of the magnetoconductance is consistent with the anomalous transport of an axionic charge-density wave. Our results show that it is possible to find experimental evidence for axions in strongly correlated topological condensed matter systems, which have so far been elusive in any other context.},

However, the combination of topological bands and superconductivity promises the manifestation of exotic superconducting states, including Majorana fermions, the central component of topological quantum computation. Here, using laser-based, spin-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we have identified both topological insulator and Dirac semimetal states near the Fermi energy in different iron-based superconducting compounds. Carrier doping can tune these topologically non-trivial bands to the Fermi energy, potentially allowing access to several different superconducting topological states in the same material. These results reveal the generic coexistence of superconductivity and multiple topological states in iron-based superconductors, indicating that this broad class of materials is a promising platform for high-temperature topological superconductivity.},

It was discovered that the 1D topological edge states are present in single-unit-cell FeSe film on SrTiO3, but are absent when more than 50{\%} Se atoms are replaced by Te atoms. Stress induced displacive phase transformation exists in FeSe/SrTiO3 film when Te atoms substitute Se atoms in the bottom (top) layer in single-layer FeSe under 3{\%} strain respectively. The 1D topological edge states are present under 3{\%} (1.8{\%}) strain in FeSe/SrTiO3 films with Te substitution Se in the bottom (top) layer in single-layer FeSe, even up to 5{\%}, respectively. This indicates that the bonding angle of Se-Fe-Se (Te) and the distance of Te (or Se) atoms to the Fe plane are correlated with the topological edge states. Our findings provide an effective interface system that provides both superconducting and topological states, opening a new route for realizing 2D topological superconductors with proximity effect.},

Wang et al. looked for signatures of MBSs in this material by using scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the vortex cores formed by the application of a magnetic field. In addition to conventional states, they observed the characteristic zero-bias peaks associated with MBSs and were able to distinguish between the two, owing to the favorable ratios of energy scales in the system.Science, this issue p. 333The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional superconducting topological materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex cores. By using scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45, we observed a sharp zero-bias peak inside a vortex core that does not split when moving away from the vortex center. The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.},

@article{Zhang2018S,
	abstract = {A promising path toward topological quantum computing involves exotic quasiparticles called the Majorana bound states (MBSs). MBSs have been observed in heterostructures that require careful nanofabrication, but the complexity of such systems makes further progress tricky. Zhang et al. identified a topological superconductor in which MBSs may be observed in a simpler way by looking into the cores of vortices induced by an external magnetic field. Using angle-resolved photoemission, the researchers found that the surface of the iron superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 satisfies the required conditions for topological superconductivity.Science, this issue p. 182Topological superconductors are predicted to host exotic Majorana states that obey non-Abelian statistics and can be used to implement a topological quantum computer. Most of the proposed topological superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures. By using high-resolution spin-resolved and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that the iron-based superconductor FeTe1{\textendash}xSex (x = 0.45; superconducting transition temperature Tc = 14.5 kelvin) hosts Dirac-cone{\textendash}type spin-helical surface states at the Fermi level; the surface states exhibit an s-wave superconducting gap below Tc. Our study shows that the surface states of FeTe0.55Se0.45 are topologically superconducting, providing a simple and possibly high-temperature platform for realizing Majorana states.},

	abstract = {Quantum phase transitions in metals are often accompanied by violations of Fermi liquid behavior in the quantum critical regime. Particularly fascinating are transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson concept of a local order parameter. The breakdown of the Kondo effect in heavy-fermion metals constitutes a prime example of such a transition. Here, the strongly correlated f electrons become localized and disappear from the Fermi surface, implying that the transition is equivalent to an orbital-selective Mott transition, as has been discussed for multi-band transition-metal oxides. In this article, available theoretical descriptions for orbital-selective Mott transitions will be reviewed, with an emphasis on conceptual aspects like the distinction between different low-temperature phases and the structure of the global phase diagram. Selected results for quantum critical properties will be listed as well. Finally, a brief overview is given on experiments which have been interpreted in terms of orbital-selective Mott physics.},

Furthermore, we report the observation of a transition from the cubic Rashba effect to the coexistence of linear and cubic Rashba effects in the oxide heterostructures, which is controlled by the filling of Ti orbitals.

These two concepts, ubiquitous in both condensed matter and high energy physics, have been applied successfully in the last decades to unravel a plethora of complex phenomena. Their interplay, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we report how, in the presence of strong correlations, symmetry protection emerges from a set of configurations enforced by another broken symmetry. This mechanism spawns different intertwined topological phases, where topological properties coexist with long-range order. Such a singular interplay gives rise to interesting static and dynamical effects, including interaction-induced topological phase transitions constrained by symmetry breaking, as well as a self-adjusted fractional pumping. This work paves the way for further exploration of exotic topological features in strongly-correlated quantum systems.},

	abstract = {Paramagnetic heavy fermion insulators consist of fully occupied quasiparticle bands inherent to Fermi liquid theory. The gap emergence below a characteristic temperature is the ultimate sign of coherence for a many-body system, which in addition can induce a non-trivial band topology. Here, we demonstrate a simple and efficient method to compare a model study and an experimental result for heavy fermion insulators. The temperature dependence of the gap formation in both local moment and mixed valence regimes is captured within the dynamical mean field (DMFT) approximation to the periodic Anderson model (PAM). Using the topological coherence temperature as the scaling factor and choosing the input parameter set within the mixed valence regime, we can unambiguously link the theoretical energy scales to the experimental ones. As a particularly important result, we find improved consistency between the scaled DMFT density of states and the photoemission near-gap spectra of samarium hexaboride (SmB6).},

	abstract = {The correlation-driven topological insulator is a poorly understood state of matter where topological protection is afforded in the absence of well-defined quasiparticles. Ongoing research is hampered by the scarcity of model material families, consisting of only the 4f rare-earth boride compounds thus far. Here we establish a class of candidate topological Kondo insulator in FeSb2, based on 3d electrons instead of 4f electrons. Comparison between the different families will allow identification of key ingredients responsible for the exotic insulating state. Our band-structure measurements will serve as important guides for theoretical modeling of the correlated insulating state in this system.The resistance of a conventional insulator diverges as temperature approaches zero. The peculiar low-temperature resistivity saturation in the 4f Kondo insulator (KI) SmB6 has spurred proposals of a correlation-driven topological Kondo insulator (TKI) with exotic ground states. However, the scarcity of model TKI material families leaves difficulties in disentangling key ingredients from irrelevant details. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study FeSb2, a correlated d-electron KI candidate that also exhibits a low-temperature resistivity saturation. On the (010) surface, we find a rich assemblage of metallic states with two-dimensional dispersion. Measurements of the bulk band structure reveal band renormalization, a large temperature-dependent band shift, and flat spectral features along certain high-symmetry directions, providing spectroscopic evidence for strong correlations. Our observations suggest that exotic insulating states resembling those in SmB6 and YbB12 may also exist in systems with d instead of f electrons.},

It is described by a simple Laughlin wavefunction and has been thoroughly studied both theoretically and experimentally. In lattice systems, however, much less is currently known, and only few models and mechanisms leading to it have been identified. Here we propose a new way of constructing lattice Hamiltonians with local interactions and fractional quantum Hall like ground states. In particular, we obtain a spin 1/2 model with a bosonic Laughlin-like ground state, displaying a variety of topological features. We also demonstrate how such a model naturally emerges out of a Fermi--Hubbard-like model at half filling, in which the kinetic energy part possesses bands with non-zero Chern number, and we show how this model can be implemented in an optical lattice setup with present or planned technologies.},

Here we report a practical method to identify topological phases in arbitrary realistic models by accurately calculating the topological entanglement entropy using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We argue that the DMRG algorithm systematically selects a minimally entangled state from the quasi-degenerate ground states in a topological phase. This tendency explains both the success of our method and the absence of ground-state degeneracy in previous DMRG studies of topological phases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure by obtaining the topological entanglement entropy for several microscopic models, with an accuracy of the order of 10−3, when the circumference of the cylinder is around ten times the correlation length. As an example, we definitively show that the ground state of the quantum S = 1/2 antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice is a topological spin liquid, and strongly constrain the conditions for identification of this phase of matter.},

@article{Wen2019S,
	abstract = {The discovery of topological phases of matter forced condensed matter physicists to question and reexamine some of the basic notions of their discipline. Wen reviews the progress of the field that took a sharp turn from Landau{\textquoteright}s broken symmetry paradigm to arrive at the modern notions of topological order and quantum entanglement in many-body systems. This development was made possible by using increasingly sophisticated mathematical formalisms.Science, this issue p. eaal3099BACKGROUNDOur world is very rich. One aspect of its richness is reflected in the existence of many different phases of matter. More than half a century ago, Landau developed a theory to describe phases of matter on the basis of symmetry breaking. He pointed out that the distinction between different phases stems from the way their constituent particles are organized (ordered); different phases correspond to different symmetries of the particles{\textquoteright} ordering. For many years, it was widely believed that the symmetry-breaking theory described all phases and all phase transitions.ADVANCESHowever, the study of chiral spin liquids and quantum Hall (QH) liquids eventually revealed phases of matter and organizations of particles not described by the symmetry-breaking theory. This new kind of order was referred to as topological order, because it is closely related to the topological quantum field theory introduced by Witten in 1989.It took researchers 20 years to realize that topological order is nothing but the patterns of quantum entanglement in many-body systems, which can be intuitively understood via two analogies to dancing: (i) Dance of particles (or step dance). Particles move in a spiral fashion and take a fixed number of steps to dance around each other. (ii) Dance of strings. The local degrees of freedom form strings that join in a particular way (see the figure). The strings can dance by moving around and reconnecting freely.The first type of dance, the step dance, describes topological order in chiral spin liquids and QH liquids, whereas the string dance describes topological order in other spin liquids. The QH liquids have been realized by electron systems at the interface of semiconductors and by graphene, under strong magnetic fields. The topological order categorized by the string dance may be realized by electron spins in certain materials, such as herbertsmithite and RuCl3.In the string-net liquids described by the string dance, the strings can be viewed as the {\textquotedblleft}electric{\textquotedblright} flux of a gauge theory, and the string density wave give rise to an emergent (non-Abelian) gauge field. The ends of the strings are topological excitations that may carry fractional charges, fractional (non-Abelian) statistics in two-dimensional (2D) systems, and Fermi statistics in 3D systems. The QH liquids categorized by the step dance also have emergent gauge theory{\textemdash}the Chern-Simons gauge theory. This type of dance leads to indestructible perfect conducting boundaries, as well as indestructible qubits (units of quantum information). Topologically ordered states are materials with intriguing properties, which may be useful in electronic devices and topological quantum computation.OUTLOOKThe emergence of topological phases of matter from the patterns of many-body quantum entanglement is a truly new phenomenon. New mathematics is needed to describe and classify topological orders. Recent studies have revealed that a unitary modular tensor category is required to classify 2D bosonic topological orders, and unitary braided fusion categories are necessary to classify 2D fermionic topological orders. To classify 2D topological orders with symmetry G, a G-cross unitary modular tensor category (for bosons) or a unitary braided fusion categories over Rep(G) (for bosons and fermions) is needed. However, the mathematical theory, including higher-category theory, to classify topological orders in three dimensions and beyond is still evolving.Many-body entanglement is not only the origin of many new states of quantum matter (such as topological orders), it is also the origin of emergent gauge fields, as well as emergent Fermi or fractional statistics, from the simple bosonic qubits that form the system. Recent work has indicated that our empty space itself might be a system formed by many qubits{\textemdash}a qubit ocean. In other words, the space itself is formed by entangled qubits; if there is no qubit, there is no sense of space. The entanglement of the qubits provides a sense of neighborhood and dimension of the space. If the quantum entanglement of the qubits in the ocean is described by a particular string-net dance, then the string density waves in the string-net liquid generate electromagnetic waves that satisfy the Maxwell equation and gluon waves that satisfy the Yang-Mills equation. String ends produce electrons and quarks that carry Fermi statistics and satisfy the Dirac equation. Those emergent gauge fields and fermions are the elementary particles in the standard model. Such an emergence picture based on string-nets represents a unification of matter and information (see the figure).String-nets.Local degrees of freedom form strings (colored lines), which can then join in a specific way to create a string-net. Sting-net liquids can give rise to emergent (non-Abelian) gauge theory, emergent fractional or non-Abelian statistics (in 2+1D), and emergent fermions (in 3+1D). This concept unifies gauge interaction and Fermi statistics and provides a cohesive origin for light and electrons, as well as other elementary particles.It has long been thought that all different phases of matter arise from symmetry breaking. Without symmetry breaking, there would be no pattern, and matter would be featureless. However, it is now clear that for quantum matter at zero temperature, even symmetric disordered liquids can have features, giving rise to topological phases of quantum matter. Some of the topological phases are highly entangled (that is, have topological order), whereas others are weakly entangled (that is, have symmetry-protected trivial order). This Review provides a brief summary of these zero-temperature states of matter and their emergent properties, as well as their importance in unifying some of the most basic concepts in nature.},

@article{Broholm2020S,
	abstract = {Materials with interacting quantum spins that nevertheless do not order magnetically down to the lowest temperatures are candidates for a materials class called quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and are tricky to study theoretically; an even more difficult task is to experimentally prove that a material is a QSL. Broholm et al. take a broad view of the state of the field and comment on the upcoming challenges.Science, this issue p. eaay0668BACKGROUNDYears ago, Lev Landau taught us how to think about distinct phases of matter through an order parameter that characterizes the symmetry-broken state relative to the symmetry-preserving state from which it emerges. More recently, however, it has been realized that not all phases of matter are captured by this paradigm. This was spectacularly demonstrated by the discovery of fractional quantum Hall states in the 1980s. Over the years, it has been elucidated that these states, along with their exotic excitations{\textemdash}quasiparticles carrying a rational fraction of the elementary charge of an electron{\textemdash}are the consequence of topological properties of ground state wave functions with a special type of long-range quantum entanglement. One might wonder whether analogous phenomena occur for spins. Whether these {\textquotedblleft}quantum spin liquids{\textquotedblright} actually exist in nature has been the subject of much investigation.ADVANCESSince Philip Anderson contemplated the idea of quantum spin liquids in 1973, there has been a lot of research to establish what they are and how they can be characterized. Of particular note was the realization that an effective low-energy theory inevitably resembles the gauge theory treatments also invoked in high-energy physics. However, these gauge fields are {\textquotedblleft}emergent{\textquotedblright} in the sense that they reflect important structure of the many-particle state. Specifically, they describe excitations that carry a fraction of the quantum of spin in terms of emergent quasiparticles with gauge charge and/or gauge flux, analogous to the electric charge and magnetic flux in electrodynamics. One consequence is that these quasiparticle excitations can have nontrivial statistical interactions when they are braided around each other. Although most studies have focused on gapped spin liquids, equally intriguing are gapless versions{\textemdash}for instance, ones where the quasiparticle ({\textquotedblleft}spinon{\textquotedblright}) spectrum is that of relativistic electrons described by the Dirac equation. Much work has been done to address specific models and connect them to experimental analogs. This has involved a combination of analytically solvable models, as well as the development of new numerical methods that provide approximate solutions given a microscopic (lattice scale) Hamiltonian.Perhaps most excitingly, there has been an increasingly promising effort to identify quantum spin liquids in nature. Much of the work has focused on materials where the magnetic ions reside on lattices that frustrate classical magnetic order. Examples include the triangular, kagome, hyperkagome, and pyrochlore lattices. Several candidate materials have been discovered, including organic salts, where molecular dimers realize spin-{\textonehalf} degrees of freedom on a distorted triangular lattice; herbertsmithite, where spin-{\textonehalf} copper ions form a kagome lattice; and α-RuCl3, where j =1/2 ruthenium ions form a honeycomb lattice and that is thought to be proximate to the famous Kitaev model. All of these materials have properties reminiscent of spin liquids, though their documented fidelity as model systems is limited by disorder, subleading interactions, or lack of experimental information.OUTLOOKGiven the infinite variety of potential materials and the many research groups now exploring this space, we are optimistic that a pristine materials realization of a quantum spin liquid will be discovered in the coming years. Perhaps even now a spin liquid exists in a long-forgotten drawer of a museum. Efforts to achieve ultrahigh-quality samples and new experiments designed to determine whether fractionalization and long-range entanglement occur in such materials will be key. In addition to tantalizing clues based on such techniques as thermal Hall conductivity, nuclear magnetic resonance, and inelastic neutron scattering, future methods may involve looking for spin currents to prove fractionalization, as has been done for charge degrees of freedom in the fractional quantum Hall case, or probing the range and character of quantum entanglement, as previously done in ultracold gases. Moreover, if quasiparticle excitations can be isolated and then manipulated, the prospect of a new form of topologically protected quantum computation also exists. Finally, chemically doped versions of spin liquids have been predicted to provide an unconventional route to superconductivity. The search for such phases will undoubtedly be an exciting undertaking.Emergent gauge theory as fluctuating loops. The loops are flux lines, with {\textquotedblleft}particles{\textquotedblright} living at the ends of open lines. Left: The loops are dilute and small. The line connecting the particles costs a finite energy per unit length; the particles are confined. Right: The loops are numerous and include a fraction that are of macroscopic extent; the particles are free to move apart. This is the deconfined (spin liquid) phase.Spin liquids are quantum phases of matter with a variety of unusual features arising from their topological character, including {\textquotedblleft}fractionalization{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}elementary excitations that behave as fractions of an electron. Although there is not yet universally accepted experimental evidence that establishes that any single material has a spin liquid ground state, in the past few years a number of materials have been shown to exhibit distinctive properties that are expected of a quantum spin liquid. Here, we review theoretical and experimental progress in this area.},

	abstract = {The copper oxide-based high-temperature superconductors display a mysterious {\textquotedblleft}pseudogap{\textquotedblright} metal phase at temperatures just above the critical temperature in a regime of low hole density. Extensive experimental and numerical studies have yielded much information on the nature of the electron corrections, but a fundamental theoretical understanding has been lacking. We show that a theory of a metal with topological order and emergent gauge fields can model much of the numerical data. Our study opens up a route to a deeper understanding of the long-range quantum entanglement in these superconductors and to the direct detection of the topological characteristics of the many-body quantum state.We compute the electronic Green{\textquoteright}s function of the topologically ordered Higgs phase of a SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating antiferromagnetism on the square lattice. The results are compared with cluster extensions of dynamical mean field theory, and quantum Monte Carlo calculations, on the pseudogap phase of the strongly interacting hole-doped Hubbard model. Good agreement is found in the momentum, frequency, hopping, and doping dependencies of the spectral function and electronic self-energy. We show that lines of (approximate) zeros of the zero-frequency electronic Green{\textquoteright}s function are signs of the underlying topological order of the gauge theory and describe how these lines of zeros appear in our theory of the Hubbard model. We also derive a modified, nonperturbative version of the Luttinger theorem that holds in the Higgs phase.},

@article{Li2020NRP,
	abstract = {Samarium hexaboride (SmB6) is an example of a Kondo insulator, in which strong electron correlations cause a band gap to open. SmB6 hosts both a bulk insulating state and a conductive surface state. Within a Fermi-liquid framework, the strongly correlated ground-state electronic structure can be mapped to a simple state resembling a topological insulator. Although uncertainties remain, many experiments provide compelling evidence that the conductive surface states have a topological origin. However, the bulk behaviour is less well understood and some experiments indicate bulk in-gap states. This has inspired the development of many theories that predict the emergence of new bulk quantum phases beyond Landau's Fermi-liquid model. We review the current progress on understanding both the surface and the bulk states, especially the experimental evidence for each. A mystery centres on the existence of the bulk in-gap states and why they appear in some experiments but not others. Adding to the mystery is why quantum oscillations in SmB6 appear only in magnetization but not in resistivity. We conclude by elaborating on three questions: why SmB6 is worth studying, what can be done to move forwards and what other correlated insulators could give additional insight.},

The history of Kondo insulators is reviewed along with the theoretical models used to describe these heavy fermion compounds. The Fu-Kane method of topological classification of insulators is used to show that hybridization between the conduction electrons and localized f electrons in these systems gives rise to interaction-induced topological insulating behavior. Finally, some recent experimental results are discussed, which appear to confirm the theoretical prediction of the topological insulating behavior in samarium hexaboride, where the long-standing puzzle of the residual low-temperature conductivity has been shown to originate from robust surface states. },

Here we show that the binding energy of electron--hole pairs excited through this gap is larger than the gap itself in the paradigmatic case of monolayer T′MoS2, which we investigate from first principles using many-body perturbation theory4. This paradoxical result hints at the instability of the T′phase in the presence of spontaneous generation of excitons, and we predict that it will give rise to a reconstructed `excitonic insulator'ground state5--7. Importantly, we show that in this monolayer system, topological and excitonic order cooperatively enhance the bulk gap by breaking the crystal inversion symmetry, in contrast to the case of bilayers8--16 where the frustration between the two orders is relieved by breaking time reversal symmetry13,15,16. The excitonic topological insulator is distinct from the bare topological phase because it lifts the band spin degeneracy, which results in circular dichroism. A moderate biaxial strain applied to the system leads to two additional excitonic phases, different in their topological character but both ferroelectric17,18 as an effect of electron--electron interaction.},

@article{Qian2014S,
	abstract = {Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect materials feature edge states that are topologically protected from backscattering. However, the small band gap in materials that have been identified as QSH insulators limits applications. We use first-principles calculations to predict a class of large-gap QSH insulators in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with 1T' structure, namely, 1T'-MX2 with M = (tungsten or molybdenum) and X = (tellurium, selenium, or sulfur). A structural distortion causes an intrinsic band inversion between chalcogenide-p and metal-d bands. Additionally, spin-orbit coupling opens a gap that is tunable by vertical electric field and strain. We propose a topological field effect transistor made of van der Waals heterostructures of 1T'-MX2 and two-dimensional dielectric layers that can be rapidly switched off by electric field through a topological phase transition instead of carrier depletion.Much like graphene, twodimensional flakes of transition metal dichalcogenides have appealing electronic properties. Qian et al. now find that certain structures of these materials may also exhibit the so-called spin Hall effect. The spin Hall effect represents an exotic state of matter in which a 2D material conducts electricity along its edge in a way that drastically reduces dissipation. To show this, the researchers used first-principle calculations and found that the materials also feature a large band gap, which reduces undesirable conduction through the bulk. Their proposed device could be switched on and off quickly using an electric field.Science, this issue p. 1344},

Moreover, the electron-phonon interaction can give rise to important effects, like phaseseparation and charge-ordering, and it assumes a predominance of forward scattering even if thebare interaction is assumed to be local (momentum independent).

	abstract = {The finite-temperature phase diagram of the attractive Hubbard model is studied by means of the dynamical mean-field theory. We first consider the normal phase of the model by explicitly frustrating the superconducting ordering. In this case, we obtain a first-order pairing transition between a metallic phase and a paired phase formed by strongly coupled incoherent pairs. The transition line ends in a finite temperature critical point, but a crossover between two qualitatively different solutions still occurs at higher temperature. Comparing the superconducting- and the normal-phase solutions, we find that the superconducting instability always occurs before the pairing transition in the normal phase, i.e. Tc &gt; Tpairing. Nevertheless, the high-temperature phase diagram at T &gt; Tc is still characterized by a crossover from a metallic phase to a preformed pair phase. We characterize this crossover by computing different observables that can be used to identify the pseudogap region, like the spin susceptibility, the specific heat and the single-particle spectral function.},
