Here is a list of changes included in the revised manuscript 

* Revised the title to more clearly reflect the novelty and improvements introduced in this version of the library.
* Added references to DMFT results in the introduction.
* Clarified the nature of the indices $\{i,j,k,l\}$ in the general interaction term. 
* Specified upper and lower bounds in Eq.~(14); the same clarification was propagated to all equations involving traces over Hamiltonian states.
* Corrected the definition of bosonic creation and annihilation operators.
* Added reference to the broadening parameters in the examples. 
* Introduced distinct notation to differentiate the exact partition function $Z$ from its truncated approximation $\tilde{Z}$.   
* Added details explaining subtle issues related to off-diagonal bath optimization.
* Clarified the role of the integer parameters `istart, iend, ishift` used in parallel matrix construction. Removed misleading terminology and references to parallelism in the Julia interface.
* Clarified the role of phonons' shift term $A_m$.
* Improved the explanation of the symmetry sector indexing map.  
* Corrected various typographical errors throughout the manuscript.
